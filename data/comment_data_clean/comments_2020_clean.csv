Also you can't sit around waiting for battery tech to be optimized before deciding its a good idea. I agree battery tech isn't where we need it to be but if there was no demand for mass production of batteries, then we would never get to a place where there is a demand for more efficient manufacturing and recycling of battery tech. We've been sitting on the same old battery tech for over 100 years because there was no reason to optimize it's production.

During that time we've seen extreme booms in petrol engines (thanks to the fuel crisis in the 80s). Massive advancements in computer tech, thanks to massive demands in computing needs and smart phone development. And now I feel like its finally time to develop battery tech and unfortunately its going to have to come at the expense of a few years of inefficient battery manufacturing to be able to get to a place where we can be happy with the results of our battery tech.

Even investing in hybrids won't get us where we need to be in that department because batteries aren't the primary power source in those power units. All we achieve with hybrids is defer the research and development of batteries, while we making a profit from using petrol as a main power source. 

Sorry for the rant (if anyone is even reading it) but I think it's important that we have these years of uphill battles before our huge battery tech discovery. I'm not saying we shouldn't challenge it, but we need to be optimistic of the implications for the future and encourage development of what could be our next big discovery in humanity thus far.",none,,2023-12-02 21:37:27.602828,0.0

Climate Change is marketing slogan not a change in climate.   The back of the United Nation's IPCC science report has a legal statement of data transparency that they took their greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude and only that one altitude.  It is high school taught science there is no greenhouse radiant energy more than 20 meters from radiating surface, typically the earth.  Since there is a statement of data transparency that means the IPCC is not in-fact discussing greenhouse gases in a manor conducive to global warming it is not fraud.  It's a form of marketing because they are truthful in their data transparency.  

BEVs were developed to reduce the dependance of transpiration on petroleum.  They have some very desirable secondary benefits that they don't create irritating levels of local air pollution.  Which is a huge benefit in metropolitan areas of more than a few million people.   BEVs in the USA can provide a large cost savings in energy.  If charging at home it cost about 1/3 - 1/4 the amount of gasoline.   BEVs can have such large acceleration of well less than 4 seconds to 60 mph that such a gasoline powered car would likely be a gasoline hog even when going down the interstate.  

The disadvantages of current BEVs are a battery that adds 800 pounds to a typical car's weight over a gasoline performance car equivalent.   The bigger EV's are in the thousands of pounds heavier.   Right now BEVs are best for local driving where the vehicle can come home and charge in garage over night.  Doing that they could commute a couple of hundred miles a day very well, but as a road trip car they can't keep up with convention vehicles.   The current lithium batteries loose charge over a few weeks.  They are not good for storing energy over large fractions of a year. 

Battery technology if it can be made to approach the abilities of solid electrolyte batteries would allow about a 70% increase in kWh/kg ratio, they don't catch fire when punctured, and they can take much higher heat allowing them to fully charge in about 10 minutes.   They can also discharge at much higher rates.  They have multiple times more cycle charge and discharges than other batteries.   

It may not be possible to mass produce solid electrolyte batteries with their vaporized metal disposition process currently used.  They are also brittle.  Subject to micro fractures that breaks them.   About six months for experimental vehicles before solid state batteries break from micro fractures from some of the reports.   People want expensive batteries to last a very long time and never just break.   There is no talk of chemical battery technology beyond the ability of solid state batteries.    Twice and bit more the kWh to mass ratio of current lithium batteries might be about as far as battery energy density can go.  That is still a large hindrance for large users of energy such as earth moving equipment, locomotives, aircraft, ocean crossing ships.",none,,2023-12-02 21:37:27.603087,0.0

A Tesla Model 3 or Y battery pack has a practical lifespan of 400-500k miles.  Even more for the LiFe batteries in the China and Europe models.  The car itself is designed to last 1 million miles.

Sustainable energy production is increasing at a logarithmic rate.  within another decade or two, there will be enough sustainable energy on the grid to make a *good* EV such as those produced by Tesla far and away the winner in greenhouse gas emissions and also in comfort and performance.   It is a cleaner, longer lasting, better performing, less expensive to own and operate alternative to your comparable ICE or hybrid vehicle, and its lead in all of these areas continues to increase every year.

Tesla's dry electrode process consumes far less energy to produce battery cells as there is no need to bake the substrate in ovens to evaporate and recapture the solvents.  They have been working on it for about 3 years now, and progress is continuing although admittedly at a slower pace than initially expected.  Still, within another 5yrs or so, it will begin to become the standard way lithium cells are made and will drastically reduce CO2 emissions related to battery production.

There is absolutely no reason why we can't reduce our fossil fuel use by 80+ % in the developed world within another decade or two.  We can do it, are doing it, and will do it.

I may not agree on everything, but overall it's really not bad. The speaker sounds a bit like me... 3 years ago... which is how old the video is 🙂

About the green fuels. I think one of the reasons it won't be a thing, is because once we have enough renewable energy to make those fuels, we will also have enough to mine the materials we need to make the batteries so we can just use the energy directly instead of going through the very inefficient loop of turning it into fuel and then burning it in an internal combustion engine. I believe the max attainable efficiency is 46%. And it still makes NoX, which we don't want.

The same is true for Hydrogen. If we have enough renewable energy to make that hydrogen (aka green Hydrogen, not blue or grey), you start asking why you'd burn it at a low efficiency while also making Nox. Then you'll look at a Fuel Cell, and once you do that, the car is electric anyway. Might as well use a battery, much more efficient.

I also wonder if the lifetime emissions of the ICE-vehicle really accounts for the entire chain. From another popular video here in YT, apparently the electricity we use to power just the pump jacks in the US is enough to power 15 million Teslas. The Diesel used to generate electricity on offshore rigs, if we instead used that to charge EVs, would charge another 4 million of them. Then we still have to pump that oil through pipelines, and refine it (about 75% of what is in a barrel eventually turns into Petrol or Diesel). And then we burn that in an internal combustion engine at maybe 35% (in our current vehicles), with even less reaching the wheels?

I'm not convinced it really takes 180 000 miles to break even. I have a suspicion (but cannot prove it yet) that it must happen much sooner.

As a last note: From his slides, and the 125 mile estimated range of the car, I deduct that he was using a BMW i3 for those numbers. That car was built in Germany, in a factory powered by wind power, and even the materials inside the car is recycled plastic and hemp.

horses is recycled is wrong. Plants do not care where CO2 is produced, they turn the CO2
into oxygen anyway.
Also maybe global warming causes an increase in CO2 levels because of increased animal
and plant kingdom respiration of CO2. Be aware that plant kingdom only coverts CO2 to 
oxygen during sunny days and gives off only CO2 at night and cloudy days.
Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, it is as important as oxygen for living things to survive.
The plant kingdom needs CO2 to grow. Greenhouse farmers pump CO2 into greenhouses 
at up to 1200 parts per million for optimum crop growth. If the CO2 were lowered from the
400 parts per million to 150 ppm, many plant species would not grow.
On Earth 4 billion years ago before photosynthesis began it is estimated by scientists that 
the Earth’s atmosphere was composed of 70% carbon dioxide with nitrogen making of the remainder the Earth’s atmosphere. Then 3.8 billion years ago photosynthesis began with
single cell algae and the algae thrived and other plants came into existence and over
3 billion years the oxygen levels rose to 21% and the CO2 levels fell to .04%. That oxygen 
level allowed animals including dinosaurs to exist and finally mankind appeared 130000
years ago. The plant kingdom biomass was able to process large amounts of CO2 in the 
long ago past and can still today. That is why CO2 levels are in the .04% range and not a 
problem. Al Gore’s claim that a change of .012% change of CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere

My only issue with your talk is the use of solar and wind generators...to go back to the pollution emissions you talked about in batteries the same can be said about solar and wind.
On a recent trip down to Texas I had the opportunity to see the wind farms across the nation being repaired/updated and the carbon footprint created by this exercise far outweighs the benefits to this endeavor.
As we see in today's news California is having an issue as to what to do with the outdated and burned out solar panels that contain toxic metals....they have driven out all recyclers able to deal with this and are now resorting to just burying them which will cause future ecological issues (liberal hypocrisy at it's finest I guess)
We should ask ' Why are the most efficient solar panels banned from being imported into the US?' but we are afraid of the answer.
Why is wind power pushed so hard when it shows it can not provide power equal to it's pollution defecate (that word is wrong but google correct can't fathom so...) ?
As I said...as a hotrodder I am all for electric vehicles....I have followed 'Gone Postal' , 'Killacycle' and many others and they are awesome !

One is that so-called clean energy sources are actually not clean either.  To find the exotic materials, and produce a solar panel are almost just as bad as the batteries in the hybrids and electrics, and second if you look at battery efficiency, they are extremely temperamental in climates outside of (right around) 70 degrees F (meaning you will almost NEVER get the spec mileage out of a full charge, electric or hybrid).  The first will move up the initial intercept point, and item 2 of the above items (and I have indeed experienced this with our hybrid) will most certainly increase the SLOPE of his curve for both hybrid and electric, as the batteries wont actually GET the 125 miles per charge he speaks of on a regular basis.
As a tertiary, batteries in these vehicles also have a limited lifetime, similar to your lead-acid batteries in standard vehicles.  If you divide 180,000 miles (in order to have the graphs meet) by ~15K miles per year, then that equates to 12 years, but the batteries really only have a 7-9 year life (our hybrid is having it's batteries replace right now), which means that even before you get to the graphs meeting, you will have to heavily bump up the CO2 number of the electric or hybrid vehicle for the installation of a replacement battery.

2.  They are not lying.  If they are not lying, then we have to look beyond what we have now.  This is the best we can do.
3. Now we MUST see if we can take the batteries etc we got now and make them into the size of a flea.    <--This is a process.

The CO2 from the corvette can also be consumed by grass, and transformed into Oxygen.  Oxygen is an element that we do not currently have a problem with over abundance of.  However, one could argue that the Corvette uses Oxygen during the combustion process to generate energy and CO2, so the Corvette also has that same ""cycle"".  

Both the horse and the corvette add CO2 to the air.  The claim is also made that, given the same mileage, a horse emits more CO2 than a corvette.  What is missing here is that a horse is much slower than a corvette, and requires much more rest.  A person using a horse for transportation would likely travel much less mileage than a person with a corvette.

According to the EPA an average car gives off 4600kg of CO2 per year (that does NOT include the CO2 given off extracting and refining the fossil fuel)

According to MIT a car battery's construction gives off between 2400kg and 16000kg of CO2. It also states that 1000kg of CO2 is roughly equivalent to 2,500 miles of driving in a gas powered car (not including the CO2 released to extract and refine the gas remember) which actually means that if we take the worst case scenario for the battery at 16,000kg, that is the equivalent of 40,000 miles which is actually the lowest estimation he gave before the BEV is giving off less CO2.......If you do the reverse of that and assume best case scenario, that's around 6000 miles before the BEV emissions are drastically reduced in comparison to a petroleum powered car

So, either he's being deliberately dishonest, for whatever reason, or he's working from different research which unfortunately he hasn't provided for us to scrutinize...

Also whoever taught Ted didn't take into account Volcanic eruptions or other sources such as Solar Flares which has Scientifically proven the earth heats up EVERY TIME one of these happens and Every Time it happens Co2 levels go up regardless of how many vehicles we drive. Although Ted teachers are correct that Co2 emissions are rising based on current Data only, they only taken into account ONE source and none of the other sources. In the real world it's called; ""Selective Science"" in order to support a ""World View"" based only Politics or Government Funded programs to prove ONE view only. In laymen terms it's called ""Junk Science"". Not that the science was bad to prove the areas investigated, but because it excludes other science leading to an incorrect conclusion. Also it was proven that some of the Temperature Sensor stations used to collect Global Temperatures were placed on buildings, at the ends of airport runways where jet engines blow on them, next to AC Vents heck even Burn Barrels. Those locations were supposed to be placed in grassy areas with a specific distance to any warming source like roads, buildings reflective or heat generating sources. The location of those temperature sensor stations was gathered by a private group who noticed several stations used in the data to prove global warming were higher than average. They directed people to those locations to take photo's of those stations. The locations of those particular stations has since been scrubbed from the government websites. So using ""Those"" stations and excluding ""Other"" sources from the data collection to prove Global Warming is caused solely by vehicle emissions is like trying to prove frogs with no legs can't hear. Ie. scientists put a frog on the table and clap their hands and the frog jumps. They cut all the legs off the frog and clap and the frog doesn't jump, so they conclude that frogs who have no legs can't hear. The scientific experiment is good, but the conclusion is wrong, it didn't take into account of all the facts, just selective ones. Now before you say I don't believe in Global Warming, you'd be wrong I do, but it's not caused by cars or factories on a Global scale, it's localized. Long before factories and vehicles were used science has proved our planet is warming, as evidenced by the Glaciers disappearing back then. As they melt our Global Temperature is warming because they are NOT there and soon most of them won't be, and the Co2 levels will rise naturally with or with out the use of Fossil Fuels. So I do believe in Global Warming yes, but not Man Made Global Warming. Oddly when I was a kid it was Global Cooling and it was going to kill us all in 10 years. Same old story, it was Global Cooling, then Global Warming and now it's Climate Change because the Earth keeps getting it wrong in today's Selective Science. Either way Global warming is a fact, but it's Cyclic and on average is getting warmer, but it's ""Major"" contributor is NOT Co2 from Fossil fuel vehicles or factories, those are insignificant compared to what occurs naturally on our planet. We should focus our efforts to get away from fossil fuels and go to Hydrogen Vehicles that still use the internal combustion engine but who's emissions is water vapor not Co2.

4. EV’s are great because of their overall performance, and if 100% adopted, would reduce pollution in the cities significantly. 

5. The solution of so called “renewables” is also a myth. Wind and solar power take more CO2 to be produced, are not reliable when it’s cloudy and when it’s not windy, and must always be “backed up” by fossil fuels. Battery tech is still 14 times less efficient than gasoline per pound, and the production is extremely invasive to the earths surface. 
 
6. He conveniently left out NUCLEAR POWER. Nuclear power is the safest, cleanest and yes THE cheapest to produce if the industry was not so intensely regulated, to the point where it is extremely expensive and not worth building. Nuclear could replace all fossil fuels if it were allowed to compete fairly. 

7. If the energy industry were truly able to compete freely, without the crippling regulations, especially on nuclear power, then EV’s would make even more sense.

The operational lifespan of an EV isn’t the same as an ICEV—fewer moving parts means much longer lifespan, even counting for the lifespan of the battery itself (noted by others). 3. The end-of-life energy use is not considered: how much energy is needed to process/recycle an EV vs. ICEV?

Power plants don't come about as CO2 virgins either and while conventional plants are built from brick, mortar, and steel, renewable energy plants, solar and wind, are often made of exotic materials such as plastic that are largely hydrocarbons and rare metals that are just that, rare.  You have to search far and wide for them and when you find them you need to break a lot of rocks to process them.  Another problem is that windmills only work when the wind is blowing and solar panels work an average of about 8 hours a day and really don't work that well at all above the 50th parallel either north or south.  So we are dealing with part time energy, in either case we must greatly overbuild capacity for those times the system isn't producing so that the excess when they are running can be saved in a gigantic battery for the down times. Ops, another battery story.   All this makes 'renewable' electric far more expensive than conventional power in terms of the investments involved resulting in much higher cost per unit of power produced.  Considering this with a world view, yes, the rich first world countries can maybe afford to do this, but the second and third world can't and they make up nearly two thirds of the world population.

First of all, the automobile IS in a CO2 / O2 cycle.  When a vehicle burns fossil fuels, it requires oxygen to combust the fuel.  That is why your vehicle has an air intake manifold.  And no matter where the CO2 comes from, it still gets absorbed by plants and turned back into oxygen.  Fact, our atmosphere is a bit more than 20% oxygen, or 200,000 parts per million.  Fact, our atmosphere is approximately 416 parts per million CO2, or about 0.0416%.  This is up from estimates 200 years ago of about 300 PPM.  So yes, we have seen a significant increase over past levels.  But as a percentage of our atmosphere, the rise is miniscule, and less than one PPM per year since the start of the industrial revolution.  What are the true effects of the rise in CO2?  We have seen a greening of the planet, meaning more forests, more tillable farmland, and greater crop yields, and may possibly increase oxygen levels over time, but levels are currently remaining nearly unchanged.

Just because you need charge an EV more often than you have to fill up an ICE vehicle with fuel doesn't necessarily mean that it's putting out more emissions. Per his argument the emissions begin to be offset at the 80-to-90-thousand-mile mark, regardless of how often you have to charge it to get to that point. If I eat 1k calories three times a day, that doesn't mean that I will poo more than if I eat 500 calories six times a day. 

If it's an argument of having to go 400 miles without stopping, that's different. How many people have a 400-mile commute? I get that people don't want to go to the gas station every day, but most people do go home every day where you can recharge your car without a special trip. My commute is about 50 miles a day. I've read the average is 35 miles per day. For that the batteries charge back up in a couple of hours at most on a decent level 2 charger. For most people, if you just plug it in when you go home at the end of the day, the distance argument is moot. 

EV's may not be the best option for someone who goes on lots of long trips, but most people don't. For the occasional road trip, EV's aren't that prohibitive. I have almost 8k miles on my EV and I've only charged it away from home once, and that was just to try it.

Horses drove the movement to cars, trains and trollys in cities and towns. In the old western movies the town's roads were muddy, that mud did not often come from rain.

It doesn't consider the role that BEVs will start to play shortly in smart-grid evolution, as new features like vehicle to grid (V2G) become standard on new cars turning them all into virtual power plants. This will make BEVs pivotal in enabling faster transition to renewable energy by stabilising grid supply from otherwise unreliable generation sources, like solar and wind, making them more viable baseload generation solutions. We now have car companies like Volvo providing CO2 figures for the entire lifecycle, cradle to grave, of their ICE and BEV cars which show the BEVs are considerably lower in CO2 compared to an ICE car driven for equal distances over the life of the car. 
It has also been shown that the latest BEVs have now reached levels of efficiency that even if powered entirely from coal generated electricity, they still contribute less CO2 than an ICE car of equivalent class, driving the same distance. Granted we still couldn't push the button today anyway,  as we physically do not have the electricity generation capacity to swap every car.  But given solar and wind are now much cheaper per MWh than any other generation source, to not mandate a transition to a green energy economy with BEVs underpinning the grid would be like placing shackles around the feet of your economy.  Yes, it's going to cost to transition, but the sooner you reach that pivot point the benefit potential will be enormous.  The only people to benefit from sticking with the status quo are fossil fuel companies.",none,,2023-12-02 21:37:28.510995,0.0

Internal combustion engines don't just emit CO2; they also emit criteria pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide and airborne toxics such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzene, 1,3- butaidene, and, in the case of diesel engines, a highly toxic particulate matter. Criteria pollutants cause billions of dollars a year in damage to crops and human health (asthma for one). Airborne toxics lead to thousands of additional cases of cancer and death annually. Additionally, Graham fails to address the energy security issue associated with fossil fuels. The U.S. produces enough petroleum products to be self-sufficient, but in a global economy, producers will sell those products to the highest bidder, and that will not always be us. The Russian invasion of Ukraine shows how Germany's reliance on Russian natural gas affected worldwide markets. Were more of Germany's (and Western Europe's) vehicles fueled by domestically produced renewable energy, Russia would have no bargaining power. Which brings us to jobs.

2. Have the Total Cost of Ownership figures in the marketing brochure and literature . Also sales associate should tell the cost saving over 2-4 years period.
3. Also have reliable and multiple fast chargers in dealerships which are available 24x7. This puts emergency charging situation at ease. Also some slow AC chargers at taxi stands or areas where commercial vehicles park. 


If you see so many people switch to CNG becuase is cheaper TCO even though it costs extra for CNG kit and restricted availability for refueling.

1. Provide a reassuring and hassle free home/shop charging equipment installation.
2. Have the Total Cost of Ownership figures in the marketing brochure and literature . Also sales associate should tell the cost saving over 2-4 years period.
3. Also have reliable and multiple fast chargers in dealerships which are available 24x7. This puts emergency charging situation at ease. Also some slow AC chargers at taxi stands or areas where commercial vehicles park. 


If you see so many people switch to CNG becuase is cheaper TCO even though it costs extra for CNG kit and restricted availability for refueling.

You’ll get your answers for the seriousness TS govt has in implementing the ev policy. Till date there is no GO/Circular through a Gazette notification to the RTOs not to collect road tax and registration fees. And did you ever see anything like it is effective from so and so date?? No. How confident do you feel as a buyer when all these things happen? I would only wait for a proper GO published to the RTO and an amendment to the motor vehicle act. Until then all these videos are ev manufacturers’ media propaganda. You can even see videos as old as 2017 saying govt launched EV policy. Did they? It’s to fool people into buying EV with substandard infra. Then the RTO will collect tax just like a regular ICE vehicle saying you don’t come under the policy as they dint get an order yet. At that point what would an ev owner do? Not register your EV?? It’s a trap!,none,,2023-12-02 21:37:53.871040,0.0

However, the key to maximizing EVs as a grid resource is the use of intermediary batteries.  By 2030, it may be common for the average single family home to have 50-100 kwh of home energy storage (2-3 days-worth of electricity).  Such households simply charge their home batteries during the time when electricity is cheapest and then use the electricity whenever they want to, including deploying the power from their home batteries to their EVs.  If you have even just 25-30% of households with that kind of arrangement, electricity utilities will be able to deploy substantial renewable energy at low cost without having to worry about curtailment.",none,,2023-12-02 21:37:58.380443,0.0

He is talking about Pollution by tail pipe of the vehicle, what about electric generation pollution which is purely (70%) coal in India. Delhi is known for Electric power shortage, although i am not sure if it is the same even today. Incentive of Rs. 30K on motorcycle, Rs. 1.5 Lakh on Cars, 30l on Autorickshaw, is it common for all models and all price range. World's exisiting EV policy is not proper, i dont understand how he claims to have built based on global EV policies. Scraping incentive, road tax and insurance incentive etc is a good move but again how long will this be offered and who is going to bear the burden.  Charging station evey 3 km is a good move again who will be held responsibility of their maintainence and any safety or electrocution mishap.

I've an 86 corolla. Just installed a new engine that had came originally in 1990 corolla. It was driven about 20,000-40,000 km and i'm looking forward to repair the A.C of on this engine.

Train the new breed skilled and semi skilled breed(by the way you know that how much an EV is carrying a big source of K volts and it can be dangerous to handle)
EV batteries manufacturing

It should be started on smaller scale than it can be spread out on vast scale. And I am sure that by grace of Allah, we have talent that no one can match in the world. but most of time we miss use this talent in negative way.

We then go to Costco and buy huge piles of meat, salmon, freeze that and paper products, some clothes, etc, we walk out with 2 carts over flowing and use the rebate check  to pay for it.

Most people don't know that Kirkland brand dog kibble is made by a high end dog food manufacturer. The dog food manufacturer makes food for brands that may cost $100 per bag or more (that bag being smaller than the one you'd buy at Costco).  Therefore it is very good value indeed.  Plus, it is a good quality dog food despite the cost. Giant breed owners are very picky about what they feed their dogs because with giant breeds, good nutrition is important. We've always fed our giant breeds on Kirkland dog food and know many giant breed owners that do too.    Our dogs get through a LOT of kibble and with Kirkland we can afford it much more easily. Recently, one of my dogs, being elderly has had to move to  a different kind of kibble that is hydrolized protein so we can't feed her the Kirkland brand.  That different kibble is made by that same high end food manufacturer under their own name, and I'm paying nearly $100 per 25 pound bag!  I'm feeling the pain, let me tell you! Our other dog remains on the Kirkland Nature's Domain salmon. In surveys of dog foods, the Kirkland brand always comes out near to the top as being one of the best.

We visited the actual press and supplier for this olive oil on a trip a few years back and saw them pressing the olive oil. A great treat. We even bought some and carried it back on the plane with us. The ONLY thing I don't like is by the time the oil is pressed, packaged and shipped to Costco around the world, it's already a year old, which means it's not the absolutely freshest oil. To get that you would have to order directly from a company which we also do yearly.

The .88 is a directors price because we only have one item left and we need to get rid of it to make room for other seasonal stuff. The director makes the decision and does not need to reduce the price if he or she decides not to. Also, you need to understand that most of what we sell is sold at the same price we bought it at. Hense why we don’t sell multiple brands for one item. So for example, we won’t sell 3 brands of ketchup. Why? Larger bulk means cheaper for Costco and cheaper for the member. Another thing, companies will pay to have their products on display at the front fence and food stands, we don’t actually put them because they’re full price. Chances are we’re actually selling those products at the same price we bought them at. You need know that our membership sales are what keeps the store running.

If you see an item with .00 or .97 at the end. It's leaving soon. So if you want it, BUY it. Don't wait because once it gets to a certain amount it's sent back for full credit but we won't carry it again. 
Second, holiday items are not bought in mass quantities so if it's Easter buy the baskets right away. They go fast and usual once gone that's it. Same for the gingerbread houses. And Kirkland is TOP of the line merch. SO if you like a name brand product, Kirkland is the same. Lot lower price. TRUST ME. I KNOW. 💯💯💯👍🏽",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:09.375745,0.0

Secret #2: The rental rate may not always be as attractive as going through broker, but usually T&C are much more relaxed and prices of additional equipment and services are much lower. Depending on Your needs, renting directly through provider can be cheaper. Rental companies have their own reservation teams, don't be afraid to ask them anything, email is the best way of communication.

Secret #5: Third party insurance (bought on broker's/TA's website) will only cover You AFTER You pay for the excess, and depending on Your rate, it can be up to vehicle's full cost! Also, not before they get all of the documentation from the rental company, and sometimes that documentation - like police reports, take up to a year to obtain, depending on country.

My general advice - always book as early as You can and don't fall for the rental price alone. Read T&C and compare prices of additional equipment and services. Doesn't matter if You've booked through broker (rentalcars, kayak, etc) or directly with rental company, always communicate with the end provider to have written proof of all of the rates, and services You're not obliged to pay.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:11.049122,0.0

I rent literally over 300 days a year. THE BEST THING is to get a credit card (Costco for example) that COVERS YOUR RENTAL CAR just for using the card and declining the insurance at the time of the rental. I used to use the Citibank card and it saved me around 2k when someone slammed into the car at a stop light. The damage came in at just about 2k for a bent trunk (it really looked like 300.00 damage but you know how that goes). Also, in some cities, in order to recoup the losses from the lock downs, what was once 9.99/day is now 25.99 a day for protection. I personally save more than 8k per year using this hack. You literally make back your money in less than one week of rental. That is as much or more than the daily rental (just like resort fees at Vegas/sidebar).

I rented a car from Enterprise back in May and I had trouble from the very beginning. To start I was driving to Washington D.C.  when their tire blew out on me, it was my first time ever renting so please do not judge what I am about to say next. Their first car almost killed my friend and I, thankfully I knew what a burning tire smell like. I pulled over called roadside finally got through to this one young lady. As soon as she was about to send someone of course we got disconnected somehow. She didn't care if there was a spare or not she was going to send the tow with one just in case. So I called back in hopes to get that kind girl again but instead got some tired rude csr named Rodesha, I have to say her name because she was absolutely terrible to me! So Rodesha and I are discussing my problem the time around this time is probably 1:00 a.m. right. So as you can imagine I was tired, scared and unsure about everything else, I have terrible anxiety so I couldn't calm it. But I wasn't rude to Rodesha or anything of that nature, I couldn't understand her at some point and then there were points where she'd threaten to hang up on me. At first it seemed as if things were going well, but then got to a point of frustration for her because I couldn't understand her. Every-time I tried to redial I'd get her again, it was an absolute nightmare. Anywho she refused to send someone out, until of course I started crying. Rodesha decided she truly couldn't help so I we disconnected the call. I HAD to call the state police myself and give them my information for me to even get a tow. Once my tow guy arrived he had the nastiest attitude for someone who works in customer service, he was making smart remarks about us being on the side of the highway etc. Then to top it off he charged my Triple A for the services didn't care about it not being my vehicle. My friend and I are both in our early 20's and we had to spend the night in the middle of a NJ Walmart parking lot. Not to mention it was in the worst part of the state, Camden! Now to add to all this I was supposed to be covering an event for my radio station that was happening the next day at 9:00 a.m. I still am nowhere near DC. I didn't get a new vehicle from Enterprise until after 8 :00 a.m. ! The girls at the counter when they saw the video of my tire they couldn't believe their eyes and said they've never seen anything like that. I drive to DC for the weekend yay everything is good right? NO! Due to the mishap with their CAR I didn't make it on time and nor did I receive the right press card. My whole event and weekend went to shambles in less than 24 hours, while the event was a three day festival that one mishap limited my credibility. So to try to make a long story short, they decided to charge my insurance the fee for the back of their second vehicle flying off. The bumper flew off randomly while we were driving, I didn't hit anyones car, rocks, pole, hill, ditch etc. Is there a way to get out of that fee? They want me to pay them well over a thousand dollars for something I didn't do!!",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:11.050706,0.0

Credit cards often cover rental insurance.

If possible, book in a state/city with less or no sales tax. Example, Portland vs. Seattle. No sales tax in Oregon. This especially adds up if booking for weeks.

Foreign websites like Chinese ones often have better deals. Obviously you’ll be using the ones that offer English. Ctrip is one

When booking, it’s often smart to use the “Free upgrade” coupon on days that you know cars will be limited. This helps guarantee you’ll get an awesome luxury or SUV upgrade. Booking intermediate level cars for a few dollars more, plus the upgrade coupon is a good strategy.

Booking for a month is often as cheap as booking for 3 weeks (sometimes 2), because of monthly discount.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:11.833179,0.0

Few things he said is right. The car seat I never charged that much. It’s was like $25ish for it, that being said he didn’t always had stock (worked in a city location). The booking offsite of the airport 100% right. But make sure it’s a city location or there is extra taxes (in California at least). For the insurance, I personally would just do damage waiver and use your own for 3rd party liability. You’d be surprised what your insurance doesn’t cover so please call them first. As for third party insurance he mentioned, at my store I’m still getting your deductible collected. I have NO idea if that insurance will cover the damage and your responsible for that car fault or not. It’s up to you, just understand your responsibility and be ok with the out comes if the unfortunate occurs.

I am American, but I live and work overseas. While visiting family in the States, I rented a car at LAX and used one of my Bank of America Visa credit cards to pay for it. It had the collision damage waiver benefit for rental cars, so I didn't get any additional insurance on top of that. The following day, in rural California, I hit a deer that suddenly ran onto the freeway. Fortunately we were all safe in the vehicle, but the front of the car was an absolute mess. Very long story short, I eventually received a bill from a collections company for well over $10k!! (The car had likely been written off/ auctioned off.) After months of talking with Visa's Card Benefits Services and sending all types of paperwork and documentation,  Visa negotiated a settlement with the collections agency, and I ended up paying $0! In fact, I was surprised to learn that Visa's fine print (for my specific card) even permitted me to receive full reimbursement for the towing charges I had paid out of pocket the day of the accident ($250+). Obviously,  I was tremendously grateful. All the fine print for my card ended up working in my favor in this specific situation. Here are lessons I learned  that I will pass on to you: Read the fine print of the benefits that come with your specific card!!! Find out if there are limits to coverage, such as the number of days you'll be renting a car AND type of coverage offered by the card (secondary or primary). Check on coverage for domestic rentals vs. international rentals. If you accept any insurance from the rental car company or a third party (which I am not discouraging whatsoever here), just be aware that your credit card benefit might not cover you in the same way. Obviously,  I'm very fortunate nobody was hurt AND no other vehicles or people were involved in the accident. That certainly could have changed the financial outcome dramatically. Again, read the fine print... I'd even encourage you to take ten minutes to call your Card Benefit Services to ask questions about the coverage they provide.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:12.047996,0.0

Some tips for your next video:
1. Insurance is worth the cost if you are taking the car a far distance and or thru a place with more intense weather climates such as snow. You are not liable for any damage and it saves people a lot of hassle. 
2. Booking thru 3rd party’s will often go off without a hitch, no doubt, find your deals, but by doing this, you are not guaranteed a car and if you buy their 3rd party insurance, the car rental company will contact you and not the third party insurance. you are made a middle man to get the car fixed. I have seen many of people become very frustrated with the process.
3. A lot of rental systems will register an error and a manager will be involved if too many discounts are being applied. The counter should be able to override it for customer service reasons, but when it comes to making money, they will make you pay the difference and tell you to book straight thru the company website next time to get a more accurate price. Again, the company does not have to adhere to the price of your third party booking. And if you have a problem with that, they will tell you to contact that third party, only for you to then get lucky enough to get a refund from said third party and pay the normal rental price anyway. 
4. As he says at the end, ALWAYS get a receipt when you return the car. It is the job of the rental company to add fees before you leave and it is illegal for them to add anything after the rental is fully returned so get your proof.
Ps. You should see that 200 dollar extra processing hold on your card released back within a week and call your bank if it’s not. If you call the rental company about it, they will just tell you to call the bank because it gets released from the systems the next calendar day after return.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:12.349130,0.0

On several websites I have given my assistance to people in finding the best deal. I have even consulted with the owner of Autoslash when he was first starting. And I have the emails to prove it. Overall, your six tips were 100% spot on. I do have a 7th for you. Yes, you will always save money by prepaying for a rental. And yes, rental agents do make much of their money from add-ons. But there are some add-ons that have value, and there are some ways that rental agents make money that you didn't mention. Let me go through my number seven for you. 

Car rental agents make money from walk-ups as well. I left the car rental industry in 2007. And since then I have never paid a car rental at the lowest advertised rate utilizing any of the websites. I have beaten it, often significantly.  This also works to get a better class of car than you paid for as well.

 I have this process: I book the lowest refundable rate I can find. I make sure that it's 100% refundable and that I will not have any issues if I no-show. Then when I land, with a printed copy of my rate, I will walk to all the rental companies located on the airport. I will walk up to the agent and say ""can you beat this?"" 95% of the time I will get an agent that will find me a cheaper rate because that walk up traffic is a commission walking out the door.  Now this will not work if you have a reservation and you try to walk up to the same company that you hold a reservation for. So you need to make sure you have one safety reservation is what I call it at a rate that you can live with. Let's say that company is Avis. When you arrive at the airport you check Hertz, national, Alamo, advantage, Fox, budget or any other rental car company to see if they can beat that rate. If they don't, you stick with your safety reservation. If they do, and almost every single time they do at least give you added value for the same price, you can opt to stay or take the better rate. 

The 5% of the time that I do not get a better rate or get the same rate, it's because they are sold out in the entire airport, which is all too common right now.  However in Las Vegas in early May, I was able to secure a rate $15 per day less than my reservation with this same process. 

There is one circumstance where using the website of the rental company is useful. If the company that you work for or the association that you are a member of has a discount, you need to at least investigate what that discount will get you. For example, if you need to pay for a second driver, many discounts will make that second driver free, include collision damage waiver insurance, include a free tank of gas, or provide other benefits on top of a discount. Your mileage may quite literally vary, but if you pay $15 a day more using a company rate then auto slash can give you, but it includes full insurance, additional drivers, it allows you a free tank of gas, you might very well come out significantly ahead. For example, it's been many years but there was a marketing company that had a negotiated rate with the company that I worked for. LDW first $5,000 was covered by the company rate, additional drivers were free, the rate also allowed the use of a debit card without additional fees, also allowed underage drivers without an additional fee. To top it all off, the rate also allowed them to return the gas at any level with no charge. But they were paying a flat $50 per day unlimited mileage. In some cities, New York for example, $50 per day at that time was fantastic. But in the off season in Hawaii, cars could be had as cheap as $15 per day. But an additional driver, underage driver, insurance would add $75 per day, you can see where the company and anyone using that code who was authorized could significantly save money.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:12.349738,4.0

But on a more serious note: even though we're all the way down here in Australia, the result of this election will impact everyone on earth. In terms of climate action alone, this could be the most important election of our lifetimes.

supporter, i obviously have a bias but i have to agree with some of this. Covid isnt too big of a deal
now as its mutated to be weaker but yeah trumo saying its just the flu back whrn it first started was not a very good idea. also yes im aware trump doesnt think before he speaks and shit, but he also did good stuff to
like crrating millions of jobs, better security, low gas prices, a good economy, being tough kn foteign enemies, ect. also i agree that peacful prtests shouldnt be shut down but there were many many violent ones that had to be stopped beofre cities were burnt down. and now a lto of americabs probably regret voting for biden because he ruined this country just because he wanted to do the opposite of trump. now we have less securty, inflation, soft foreign policy and overall just worse off. who got rid of isis?? trump! who kept the taiban from
taking control before biden screwed over afganistan?? trump! its likely russia wouldnt have invaded ukraine if trump was in power to stand up tough to americas enemies. i alreacy know im gonna get yelled at in the replies because evrrhone loves to focus on the bad trump did and let me say tbis now, dont waste yout tine like i jist did writing this comment. i cant chamge the minds of a bunch of liberals who call us fascists my mind cant be changed either.

自分をごまかすのにもうウンザリなの
Where’s my happy ending?
私のハッピーエンディングはどこにあるの？

[Verse 1]
I followed all the rules
全部従ってきたわ
I drew inside the lines
線の中でお利口にしてた
I never asked for anything that wasn’t mine
I waited patiently for my time
私の輝ける時間まで辛抱強く待ってたわ
But when it finally came
He called her name
でも結局彼は彼女の名前を呼んだの
And now I feel this overwhelming pain
死ぬほどキツイわ
I mean, it’s in my veins
I mean, it’s in my brain
脳にも静脈にも痛みを感じる 
My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train
私の考えはオモチャの汽車みたいにぐるぐる回ってる
I’m kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame
私は壊れたフレームの中にある写真みたいよ
I know exactly who to blame
誰を責めるべきか分かってるわ

[Chorus 1]
I never thought of myself as mean
自分のことを意地悪なんて思ったことなかった
I always thought that I’d be the Queen
いつか女王様になると思ってたわ
And there’s no in-between
そこに中間なんてないし、いらないわ
Cause if I can’t have that
だってもし女王になれないなら
Then I will be the leader of the dark
And the bad
暗闇の邪悪の世界のリーダーになってやる
Now there’s a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
前は天使が乗っていた私の肩に悪魔が乗ってきて
And he’s calling me the Queen
私を「意地悪な女王」って呼ぶの
￼

Verse 2]
Being nice was my past time
優しかったのは昔の話
But I’ve been hurt for the last time
私は傷ついてきたの
And I won’t ever let another person take advantage of me
もう誰にも私を利用させたりしない
The anger burns my skin, third-degre
私の皮膚を怒りが焼いてるの
Now my blood’s boiling hotter than a fiery sea
私の血は燃えるような海よりも熱く沸騰してる
There’s nobody getting close to me
もう私に近づく人はいない
They’re gonna bow to the Evil Queen
みんなこの邪悪な女王にお辞儀をするのよ
Your nightmare is my dream
あなたの悪夢が私の夢になる
Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes
待ってなさい、みんなが私の邪悪な力に乗っ取られるまで

[Chorus 1]
I never thought of myself as mean
自分のことを意地悪なんて思ったことなかった
I always thought that I’d be the Queen
いつか女王様になると思ってたわ
And there’s no in-between
そこに中間なんてないし、いらないわ
Cause if I can’t have that
だってもし女王になれないなら
Then I will be the leader of the dark

Now there’s a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
前は天使が乗っていた私の肩に悪魔が乗ってきて
And he’s calling me the Queen
私を「意地悪な女王」って呼ぶの

[Verse 3]
Something’s pulling me
何かが私を強く惹きつける
It’s so magnetic
磁石みたい
My body is moving
I'm sure where I’m headed
どこに私の体が向かってるか分かってるわ
All of my senses have left me defenseless
全ての感覚は私を無防備にさせる
This darkness around me
Is promising vengeance
私を纏う暗闇は復讐を約束してくれる 
The price that I’m willing to pay is expensive
私が喜んで払う代金は高いわよ
There’s nothing to lose
もう失うものはないのよ
When you’re lonely and friendless
一人で友達もいない私は特にね
So my only interest is showing this princess
今の私のやりたいことは
That I am the Queen
この女王の力を見せること
And my reign will be endless
私の力は永遠に続く！ 
￼
[Bridge]
I want what I deserve
私にふさわしいものが欲しい
I want to rule the world
世界を支配してやるわ
Sit back and watch them learn
座って今に見てなさいよ
It’s finally my turn
私の番よ

[Chorus 3]
If they want a villain for a Queen
みんな悪者が女王になるのを見たいなら
I’m gonna be one that they've never seen
私が誰も見たことのない女王になってやるわ
I’ll show them what it means
みんなに思い知らせてあげる
Now that I am that
I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad
暗黒の悪の世界の支配者になるの
‘Cause the devil’s on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
前までは天使がいた私の肩にいる悪魔がこう呼ぶの
And he’s calling me the Queen of Mean (Calling me, calling me) (Calling me, calling 
me)
お前は「意地悪な女王」だって
The Queen of Mean (Calling me, calling me)

I'm so tired of pretending
Where's my happy ending?
I followed all the rules
I drew inside the lines
I never asked for anything that wasn't mine
I waited patiently for my time
But when it finally came
He called her name
And now I feel this overwhelming pain
I mean it's in my veins
I mean it's in my brain
My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train
I'm kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame
I know exactly who to blame
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen
Being nice was my pastime
But I've been hurt for the last time
And I won't ever let another person take advantage of me
The anger burns my skin, third-degree
Now my blood's boiling hotter than a fiery sea
There's nobody getting close to me
They're gonna bow to the Evil Queen
Your nightmare's my dream
Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark

And he's calling me the queen of mean (calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (calling me, calling me)
Something's pulling me
It's so magnetic
My body is moving
Unsure where I'm headed
All of my senses have left me defenseless
This darkness around me
Is promising vengeance
The price that I'm willing to pay is expensive
There's nothing to lose
When you're lonely and friendless
So my only interest is showing this princess
That I am the queen
And my reign will be endless (endless)
I want what I deserve
I want to rule the world
Sit back and watch them learn
It's finally my turn
If they want a villain for a queen
I'm gonna be one like they've never seen
I'll show them what it means
Now that I am that
I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad

There is so much to unpack there, I don't know where to begin. 

There are plenty of fish in the sea. Ben decided that Mal is his ideal woman. I am sure that somewhere out there, there is a man who would love you as much as Ben loves Mal. 

It is great that you obeyed the rules and never asked for anything that wasn't your's. However, that does not entitle you to Ben's affection or the title of queen.

Where’s my happy ending?

I followed all the rules

I drew inside the lines

I never asked for anything that wasn’t mine

I waited patiently for my time

But when it finally came

He called her name

And now I feel this overwhelming pain

I mean, it’s in my veins

I mean, it’s in my brain

My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy 
train

I’m kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame

I know exactly who to blame

I never thought of myself as mean

I always thought that I’d be the Queen

And there’s no in-between

Cause if I can’t have that

Then I will be the leader of the dark
And the bad

Now there’s a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be

And he’s calling me the Queen
￼

Being nice was my past time

But I’ve been hurt for the last time

And I won’t ever let another person take advantage of me

The anger burns my skin, third-degre

Now my blood’s boiling hotter than a fiery sea

There’s nobody getting close to me

They’re gonna bow to the Evil Queen

Your nightmare is my dream

Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes

I never thought of myself as mean

I always thought that I’d be the Queen

And there’s no in-between

Cause if I can’t have that

Then I will be the leader of the dark
And the bad

Now there’s a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be

And he’s calling me the Queen of mean

Something’s pulling me

It’s so magnetic

My body is moving

I'm sure where I’m headed

All of my senses have left me defenseless

This darkness around me

Is promising vengeance

The price that I’m willing to pay is expensive

There’s nothing to lose

When you’re lonely and friendless

So my only interest is showing this princess

That I am the Queen

And my reign will be endless
￼
I want what I deserve

I want to rule the world

Sit back and watch them learn

It’s finally my turn

If they want a villain for a Queen

I’m gonna be one that they've never seen
likeって言ってない

I’ll show them what it means

Now that I am that
I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad

‘Cause the devil’s on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be

And he’s calling me the Queen of Mean (Calling me, calling me) (Calling me, calling 
me)

The Queen of Mean (Calling me, calling me)


I want what I deserve",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:30.984085,0.0

Secret #2: The rental rate may not always be as attractive as going through broker, but usually T&C are much more relaxed and prices of additional equipment and services are much lower. Depending on Your needs, renting directly through provider can be cheaper. Rental companies have their own reservation teams, don't be afraid to ask them anything, email is the best way of communication.

Secret #5: Third party insurance (bought on broker's/TA's website) will only cover You AFTER You pay for the excess, and depending on Your rate, it can be up to vehicle's full cost! Also, not before they get all of the documentation from the rental company, and sometimes that documentation - like police reports, take up to a year to obtain, depending on country.

My general advice - always book as early as You can and don't fall for the rental price alone. Read T&C and compare prices of additional equipment and services. Doesn't matter if You've booked through broker (rentalcars, kayak, etc) or directly with rental company, always communicate with the end provider to have written proof of all of the rates, and services You're not obliged to pay.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:33.550816,0.0

The damage came in at just about 2k for a bent trunk (it really looked like 300.00 damage but you know how that goes). Also, in some cities, in order to recoup the losses from the lock downs, what was once 9.99/day is now 25.99 a day for protection. I personally save more than 8k per year using this hack. You literally make back your money in less than one week of rental. That is as much or more than the daily rental (just like resort fees at Vegas/sidebar).

Our LDW will cover the rental car 100%, bumper to bumper, regardless of fault, with a zero deductible, including theft. There is a reason the CDW is  called a COLLISION damage Waiver. It only protects you in the event of a collision. Maybe theft. But is usually does not cover 100% of the vehicle. And you personal insurance will only cover up to the amount in your policy. So if your policy covers $25000 and you rent a $80000 suv, if you total that suv, you're responsible for that remaining $55000 out of pocket.

I rented a car from Enterprise back in May and I had trouble from the very beginning. To start I was driving to Washington D.C.  when their tire blew out on me, it was my first time ever renting so please do not judge what I am about to say next. Their first car almost killed my friend and I, thankfully I knew what a burning tire smell like. I pulled over called roadside finally got through to this one young lady. As soon as she was about to send someone of course we got disconnected somehow. She didn't care if there was a spare or not she was going to send the tow with one just in case. So I called back in hopes to get that kind girl again but instead got some tired rude csr named Rodesha, I have to say her name because she was absolutely terrible to me! So Rodesha and I are discussing my problem the time around this time is probably 1:00 a.m. right. So as you can imagine I was tired, scared and unsure about everything else, I have terrible anxiety so I couldn't calm it. But I wasn't rude to Rodesha or anything of that nature, I couldn't understand her at some point and then there were points where she'd threaten to hang up on me. At first it seemed as if things were going well, but then got to a point of frustration for her because I couldn't understand her. Every-time I tried to redial I'd get her again, it was an absolute nightmare. Anywho she refused to send someone out, until of course I started crying. Rodesha decided she truly couldn't help so I we disconnected the call. I HAD to call the state police myself and give them my information for me to even get a tow. Once my tow guy arrived he had the nastiest attitude for someone who works in customer service, he was making smart remarks about us being on the side of the highway etc. Then to top it off he charged my Triple A for the services didn't care about it not being my vehicle. My friend and I are both in our early 20's and we had to spend the night in the middle of a NJ Walmart parking lot. Not to mention it was in the worst part of the state, Camden! Now to add to all this I was supposed to be covering an event for my radio station that was happening the next day at 9:00 a.m. I still am nowhere near DC. I didn't get a new vehicle from Enterprise until after 8 :00 a.m. ! The girls at the counter when they saw the video of my tire they couldn't believe their eyes and said they've never seen anything like that. I drive to DC for the weekend yay everything is good right? NO! Due to the mishap with their CAR I didn't make it on time and nor did I receive the right press card. My whole event and weekend went to shambles in less than 24 hours, while the event was a three day festival that one mishap limited my credibility. So to try to make a long story short, they decided to charge my insurance the fee for the back of their second vehicle flying off. The bumper flew off randomly while we were driving, I didn't hit anyones car, rocks, pole, hill, ditch etc. Is there a way to get out of that fee? They want me to pay them well over a thousand dollars for something I didn't do!!",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:33.552333,0.0

Before trying Autoslash, a 3 day rental was $388. Autoslash immediately came back with a rate of $366. In the last 3 weeks I've gotten 5 alerts for a price drop. As of yesterday, we're down to $218. So far we're saving $170! That's crazy. We still have 2 months before our trip. I'm wondering if it will go down even more.

Credit cards often cover rental insurance.

If possible, book in a state/city with less or no sales tax. Example, Portland vs. Seattle. No sales tax in Oregon. This especially adds up if booking for weeks.

Foreign websites like Chinese ones often have better deals. Obviously you’ll be using the ones that offer English. Ctrip is one

When booking, it’s often smart to use the “Free upgrade” coupon on days that you know cars will be limited. This helps guarantee you’ll get an awesome luxury or SUV upgrade. Booking intermediate level cars for a few dollars more, plus the upgrade coupon is a good strategy.

Booking for a month is often as cheap as booking for 3 weeks (sometimes 2), because of monthly discount.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:34.098194,0.0

I am American, but I live and work overseas. While visiting family in the States, I rented a car at LAX and used one of my Bank of America Visa credit cards to pay for it. It had the collision damage waiver benefit for rental cars, so I didn't get any additional insurance on top of that. The following day, in rural California, I hit a deer that suddenly ran onto the freeway. Fortunately we were all safe in the vehicle, but the front of the car was an absolute mess. Very long story short, I eventually received a bill from a collections company for well over $10k!! (The car had likely been written off/ auctioned off.) After months of talking with Visa's Card Benefits Services and sending all types of paperwork and documentation,  Visa negotiated a settlement with the collections agency, and I ended up paying $0! In fact, I was surprised to learn that Visa's fine print (for my specific card) even permitted me to receive full reimbursement for the towing charges I had paid out of pocket the day of the accident ($250+). Obviously,  I was tremendously grateful. All the fine print for my card ended up working in my favor in this specific situation. Here are lessons I learned  that I will pass on to you: Read the fine print of the benefits that come with your specific card!!! Find out if there are limits to coverage, such as the number of days you'll be renting a car AND type of coverage offered by the card (secondary or primary). Check on coverage for domestic rentals vs. international rentals. If you accept any insurance from the rental car company or a third party (which I am not discouraging whatsoever here), just be aware that your credit card benefit might not cover you in the same way. Obviously,  I'm very fortunate nobody was hurt AND no other vehicles or people were involved in the accident. That certainly could have changed the financial outcome dramatically. Again, read the fine print... I'd even encourage you to take ten minutes to call your Card Benefit Services to ask questions about the coverage they provide.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:34.261804,0.0

Some tips for your next video:
1. Insurance is worth the cost if you are taking the car a far distance and or thru a place with more intense weather climates such as snow. You are not liable for any damage and it saves people a lot of hassle. 
2. Booking thru 3rd party’s will often go off without a hitch, no doubt, find your deals, but by doing this, you are not guaranteed a car and if you buy their 3rd party insurance, the car rental company will contact you and not the third party insurance. you are made a middle man to get the car fixed. I have seen many of people become very frustrated with the process.
3. A lot of rental systems will register an error and a manager will be involved if too many discounts are being applied. The counter should be able to override it for customer service reasons, but when it comes to making money, they will make you pay the difference and tell you to book straight thru the company website next time to get a more accurate price. Again, the company does not have to adhere to the price of your third party booking. And if you have a problem with that, they will tell you to contact that third party, only for you to then get lucky enough to get a refund from said third party and pay the normal rental price anyway. 
4. As he says at the end, ALWAYS get a receipt when you return the car. It is the job of the rental company to add fees before you leave and it is illegal for them to add anything after the rental is fully returned so get your proof.
Ps. You should see that 200 dollar extra processing hold on your card released back within a week and call your bank if it’s not. If you call the rental company about it, they will just tell you to call the bank because it gets released from the systems the next calendar day after return.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:34.495015,0.0

So after the trip, we called but they just reduced the daily rate as a courtesy, but not down to our original daily rate.

On several websites I have given my assistance to people in finding the best deal. I have even consulted with the owner of Autoslash when he was first starting. And I have the emails to prove it. Overall, your six tips were 100% spot on. I do have a 7th for you. Yes, you will always save money by prepaying for a rental. And yes, rental agents do make much of their money from add-ons. But there are some add-ons that have value, and there are some ways that rental agents make money that you didn't mention. Let me go through my number seven for you. 

Car rental agents make money from walk-ups as well. I left the car rental industry in 2007. And since then I have never paid a car rental at the lowest advertised rate utilizing any of the websites. I have beaten it, often significantly.  This also works to get a better class of car than you paid for as well.

 I have this process: I book the lowest refundable rate I can find. I make sure that it's 100% refundable and that I will not have any issues if I no-show. Then when I land, with a printed copy of my rate, I will walk to all the rental companies located on the airport. I will walk up to the agent and say ""can you beat this?"" 95% of the time I will get an agent that will find me a cheaper rate because that walk up traffic is a commission walking out the door.  Now this will not work if you have a reservation and you try to walk up to the same company that you hold a reservation for. So you need to make sure you have one safety reservation is what I call it at a rate that you can live with. Let's say that company is Avis. When you arrive at the airport you check Hertz, national, Alamo, advantage, Fox, budget or any other rental car company to see if they can beat that rate. If they don't, you stick with your safety reservation. If they do, and almost every single time they do at least give you added value for the same price, you can opt to stay or take the better rate. 

The 5% of the time that I do not get a better rate or get the same rate, it's because they are sold out in the entire airport, which is all too common right now.  However in Las Vegas in early May, I was able to secure a rate $15 per day less than my reservation with this same process. 

There is one circumstance where using the website of the rental company is useful. If the company that you work for or the association that you are a member of has a discount, you need to at least investigate what that discount will get you. For example, if you need to pay for a second driver, many discounts will make that second driver free, include collision damage waiver insurance, include a free tank of gas, or provide other benefits on top of a discount. Your mileage may quite literally vary, but if you pay $15 a day more using a company rate then auto slash can give you, but it includes full insurance, additional drivers, it allows you a free tank of gas, you might very well come out significantly ahead. For example, it's been many years but there was a marketing company that had a negotiated rate with the company that I worked for. LDW first $5,000 was covered by the company rate, additional drivers were free, the rate also allowed the use of a debit card without additional fees, also allowed underage drivers without an additional fee. To top it all off, the rate also allowed them to return the gas at any level with no charge. But they were paying a flat $50 per day unlimited mileage. In some cities, New York for example, $50 per day at that time was fantastic. But in the off season in Hawaii, cars could be had as cheap as $15 per day. But an additional driver, underage driver, insurance would add $75 per day, you can see where the company and anyone using that code who was authorized could significantly save money.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:34.495246,4.0

VW ID.3 45 kWh as an example is a fine car, will start at like $25K. And should easily+cheaply be made a bit longer for decent cargo space. Tesla needs a competitor to that car more than the ID.3 is a competitor to the clumsy Model 3. So. Much. Cheaper.
Saving cost by mounting a smaller motor is barely needed. Perhaps the inverters are a bigger impact.

But I believe there is more benefit than this because a significant portion of the spend on fuel leaves our shores - we import in excess of $30 billion worth of petrol and oil each year.   I don't believe the net benefit of the improved balance of trade that results when we reduce imported fuels is really covered by the EY analysis.  They are just saying people have a bit more money to spend on something else.  I am no economist, but it makes sense to reduce the amount of money that leaves our shores and when you do there must be some sort of additional economic benefit.

Ultimately the sad thing is that we as EV drivers are low hanging fruit as we only make up 0.6% of the fleet with the optics being that we are ‘wealthy’ being able to afford said vehicles. It scores points with the electorate also because it seems like a fair thing to do because EV drivers have been dodging the fuel excise for so long. 

Things will eventually change when affordable EVs come on the market and when uptake passes the critical mass of 30% because suddenly this new EV tax affects the average Mum and Dad voters.

To beat gas, we can explore cheap green liquid ammonia that powers fuel cells, which produces electricity, which turns motors, which turns wheels. And we can also explore standardized swappable low-range cheap plug-in EV batteries that use fewer rare earth materials.
Liquid ammonia has three big challenges: (a) it consumes three times more volume relative to gasoline per unit energy, (b) it needs to be chilled to -33°C, and (c) ammonia vapor needs to be kept out of noses. To maintain refrigeration, ammonia-based vehicles would need to maintain constant communication with a central authority, and if refrigeration failed, a service vehicle would need to visit to either repair or remove ammonia. A plug-in swappable standard refrigeration hardware unit used by all vehicles might make automated replacement easier. A refrigeration maintenance system would ultimately add to the total cost of ownership. 
The good news is that liquid ammonia fuel made with Generation 4 should be cheaper than gasoline, per unit energy. And a fuel cell's 50% efficiency is better than an internal combustion engine's 25% efficiency. Also, one can explore combusting hydrogen, as explained in this video. In summary, if engineers can get the total cost of ownership for an ammonia-based car to be less than a gasoline-based car, it might be viable.
Currently, proprietary batteries are installed in each EV car and are periodically charged. Alternatively, one could have a standard plug-in battery, where all cars use the same form, and are swapped with a fresh battery in less than 60 seconds. Car owners would pay for the energy consumed and wear on the battery. Cavities would be dug out at key locations and a mechanism would be dropped in via crane that implements charging, storage and swap. Cars would position themselves over the mechanism, and the swap would occur automatically. Swap mechanisms might be positioned next to highway on/off ramps, and next to frequented establishments. For example, the corner next to your local drug store might be convenient. If swap is easy and fast, then shorter range batteries would become more acceptable; and these tend to be cheaper and use fewer rare earth materials.
Installing swap chambers or liquid ammonia refueling infrastructure would be an enormous undertaking. 
Currently, gov't observes that EV battery prices have dropped over the past few years, extrapolates forward, and declares this as the transportation decarbonization plan. However, this might not work due to rare earth constraints. Subsequently, we should consider investing heavily in transportation that is cheaper than gas and is not resource constrained. For example, gov't could invest $10M/yr over 3 years for each of the following R&D initiatives:
•	Design swappable plug-in battery infrastructure. 
•	Design ammonia-based car.
•	Design an automated ammonia refueling station.
•	Design a standardized plug-in ammonia refrigeration unit & tank.
•	Design an automated city-wide ammonia refrigeration monitoring and maintenance system.
In summary, engineers need to figure out how to build 2,500,000 cheap green cars over ~25 years.",none,,2023-12-02 21:39:57.978767,0.0

Great video

Climate alarmists are working with globalists.  They want us to get used to the idea of electric cars because they're going to force all of us into cities.  Conveniently electric cars won't travel far so we won't be able to leave the city, stopping us from travelling.  They are setting things up such that we will live life with limits, loss of real freedom.  Just like the hypocrits now, flying in their personal of government owned plans and diesel buses across Canada ½ dozen times a summer, the elite will do exactly what they tell us we can't do or what we can't have they will have.
We're entering a period of life that's going to be very different than what my parents generation, me and my kids have grown up in.

Here in the UK (and much of Europe) we tend to travel relatively short distances and you're never far from a town or City, but when I look at the cost of buying an electric car it's WAY beyond my normal budget. The car I've got now cost me £7,800 which is the most I have EVER spent on a car; my last car was £3,500 (5 years of driving without trouble, and I sold it only because it was looking shabby) the one before that was £1,600 and the one before that was £900. 

I don't mind  a couple of dings and scratches on a car so I'd be happy enough buying a used EV, but regardless of cosmetics, the big thing about any EV is the _battery._ It loses range as it ages. Sure, from new it might - I'll pick on the Nissan Leaf for the sake or argument - as Nissan claims of the Nissan Leaf be good for 100,000 miles, but it will lose about 1/3rd of it's range long before that; and the Nissan Leaf doesn't exactly have long range to start with - around 90 miles on a full charge. Okay, that'll easily get me to work and back, but what about when the car is a little older? I commute 20 miles each way to work; I _should_ be okay on a 60 mile range, but it only leaves me 20 miles to spare so I'd better hope I don't have to take a diversion or I need to take the car out again the same day. 

The Nissan Leaf without a subsidy costs £26,000 for the most basic short-range model. £26,000? That's an awful of money. I'm spending maybe £1200 per year on fuel (plus oil - another £100 or so) so over 10 years I'd save - ignoring the cost of charging an EV - £12,000. So we can call the real price of the EV £14,000. That's still £10,000 more than I would spend on a vehicle and I would not be able to trust it to get me to work when it was over 7 years old. I wonder what the resale value is on a 10 year old EV? 

If I HAD to buy an electric car today, I could do it, but it would wipe out my meager finances and I don't know how I'd afford one in the future. 

I also wonder about the true costs if and when EV's take over. I think EV fanboys are deluding themselves that the cost of charging an EV will remain cheap. If the Government can't recoup the massive tax revenues of petrol and diesel directly from EV's, they'll take it from us indirectly. To do an apples to apples comparison, petrol in the UK in 2015 was 32.4p per litre before tax and £1.08 after tax. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2979083/Britain-one-lowest-petrol-prices-Europe-tax-highest-VAT-duty-added.html
About 65% of the cost is tax. 

Is there ANY chance the Government won't want that money? They'll take it by hook or by crook. 

I don't want to rain on EV's too much; ICE cars have all kinds of practical issues too, and I am hoping that EV's become affordable - the same price as ICE cars. But I don't see how batteries will ever be cheap enough unless a whole new futuristic technology is developed.",none,,2023-12-02 21:40:05.569141,1.0

A fact about the moonshine stuff: during prohibition, many moonshine runners had tuned up cars to outrun the police. After prohibition, they had no need to run from the police to sell it, so they started racing each other for money and respect. In 1948, a group of men got together in a hotel at Daytona Beach to establish a sanctioning body for these early stock car racing events. That sanctioning body became what we call NASCAR

19:06, A lawyer that is corrupt is as dangerous as a surgeon that is a serial killer. An ex-lawyer would know the law well, and often exploit loopholes so that if they are forced to represent themselves, they'll be able to get acquitted, and Remus is no different. The fact he actually claimed insanity and carried out good cross-examination is amazing. He's almost like our Saul Goodman today.

Fun fact: Piracy isn't illegal, just selling and distributing pirated stuff is illegal. So if anyone every sues you for using a website that just offers the stuff you want to watch, well it'd be as illegal as watching a movie through a cinema screen someone set up in a tall alleyway.

Thank you. If all our schools had your videos as required class material, we Americans’ reputation for not even knowing our own geography let alone other countries’ would dissipate overnight and we’d be #1 in primary education (what we call “grade school”). I was saved from being a statistic by your works, in addition to National Geographic, immigrant parents, a dad with a vivid knowledge of Hitler, Napoleon and Peter the Great and a bunch of really good and not-boring history teachers (one of whom made us color in and label maps of pre-WW1 Europe as homework once)

My paternal grandparents made beer and wine in their basement.  Well, actually, my grandmother made the beer and wine from recipes passed down through her family.  My grandfather owned a produce store so he could supply my grandmother whatever she needed.  The local ice cream truck driver supplied the empty root beer bottles for my grandmother to bottle the beer and wine in.  My dad recalled hearing “pop-pop-pop” noises at 1 AM from the beer bottles that were over-carbonated.

It was a great business model.  My grand father could write off whatever produce was used as spoilage, the ice cream man sold adult root beer as well as kids root beer so everything was listed as root beer.  No doubt they supplied some local speakeasies.  My grandmother even had a potato beer recipe.

I felt for that poor person who had to hang a sign to keep partygoers away. I once had a shitty roommate who only told me she was a drug supplier after she moved in. It's hard to find roommates and cheap apartments where I live, so I put up with it for a little while- people coming and going at all hours, using up my things, driving up the utilities, and generally trashing the place. I finally couldn't take any more and had her kicked out along with all her loser friends, but randos kept showing up to my place looking for mas drogas all night long. Yes, I had to put up a sign, and even then it took weeks for them to get a clue and stop showing up. Hilariously, my dad found white power under the sink a couple weeks later, assumed it was part of their stash, and called the cops. I took a closer look and discovered it was powdered dishwasher soap. The second call to the police was very awkward.

*اکثر قدیم کتابوں میں سنہ ھجری  کا ہوتا ہے اور عام لوگوں کو اس وقت کا عیسوی سنہ معلوم کرنادشوار ہوتاہے اس لئے عیسوی سنہ معلوم کرنے کا فارمولہ یا طریقہ شیر کرتا ہوں:*

*(1) سن ھجری کو پہلے 33پر تقسیم کیاجائے.*

*(2) حاصل قسمت کو اسی ھجری سن سےمنفی کیا جائے.*

*(3) جو جواب ائے اس کے ساتھ622 جمع کیا جائے(پہلے ھجری کے وقت عیسوی سنہ 622تھا).*

*(4) اس طر622 جمع کرنے کے بعد جو جواب یا ھندسہ ائےگا وہ عیسوی سن ھوگا.*
*مثلا 1200ھ سے عیسوی سنہ اس طرح بنایا جائے گا:*
1200÷33=36
1200-36=1164
1164+622=1786

*اسطرح 1200ھ 1786کے برار ہے یعنی اس وقت عیسوی سنہ 1786 تھی*

*ھجری سن معلوم کرنا:*
ھجری=(عیسوی سن -622)×33÷32
مثلا 2018 کا ھجری= (2018-622)×33÷32
2018-622=1396
1396×33=46068
46068÷32=1439
1439ھ یعنی 2018 میں ھجری 1439
یا 1200ھ
Hijri = (AD- 622) x 33 ÷ 32

For example: AD = 1786
Hijri = 1786 - 622 = 1164
        = 1164 x 33 = 38412
        = 38412 ÷ 32 
        = 1200

2)Electric vehicles are very performance based, in a country where number of accidents have increased so much recently because of speed being more accessible this cannot be a good news.

3)Electric vehicle require expensive maintenance once they do have an issue, they are reliable until they are not, electricity needs to be stable, I run a computer repair centre and the amount of burnt chargers we get is very high, same could be expected for EVs, they will have charging issues because our grid is outdated.

4)A transition period should promote hybrid vehicles instead of full EV vehicles, we see that already JDM hybrids have took over market but except Prius I am not aware of any other local selling hybrid.

This policy is just another 'good looks' policy which will be very hard to implement when you see the ground reality.

Will just bring more harm than good.

This was the same issue when plastic bags were banned, my argument was often that first a disposal system should be implemented for plastic waste instead of straight banning them. Now you have plastic and cloth based bags polluting the streets instead of just plastic.

I see the same happened with EVs, instead of going green, the vehicles will just double on the road and leave a bigger impact.",none,,2023-12-02 21:40:46.455369,1.0
