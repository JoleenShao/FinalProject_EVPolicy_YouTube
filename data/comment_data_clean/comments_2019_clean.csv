‚Ä¢ Indian landscape is different in way that it the market should focus on 2/3 wheelers & buses more than cars. Penetration is still low in Indian market.  

Challenges: 
‚Ä¢ Charging Infrastructure: very much important for persuasion to consumers to go for electric vehicles. However, for 2/3 wheelers ‚Äì Charging would be home based. 
‚Ä¢ Flyby operators - importing junk Chinese tech & assembling it here - not a dumping ground 
‚Ä¢ Federal Structure ‚Äì Multiple policies in National & State level. 

Government Steps: 
‚Ä¢ National electric mobility mission plan 2020:  providing the vision and the roadmap for the faster adoption of electric vehicles and their manufacturing in the country 
‚Ä¢ FAME-II: faster adoption & Manufacturing of electric & hybrid vehicles in India. 
‚Ä¢ Creating demand Incentives
    o Reduced cost to consumers 
    o Fiscal & non fiscal incentives by state governments. 
    o Additional income tax deduction Rs. 1.5 lakh to purchase electric vehicles
    o GST from 12 ‚Äì 5%
‚Ä¢ Establishment of charging stations: also interlinking of renewable energy sources with charging infrastructure, smart grid. 
‚Ä¢ Phased manufacturing: demand incentive linked to domestic products, battery mfg - sunrise industry

Way Forward: 
‚Ä¢ Administration of scheme including publicity, IEC(Information, education & communication) activities. 
‚Ä¢ Out of the box / non-monetary incentives ‚Äì free parking for electric vehicles, reimbursement of toll tax on highways. 
‚Ä¢ Reimagining the role of startups in this sector to meet the domestic consumption & be a global leader ‚Äì Smart, shared & Connected technology.  
‚Ä¢ R&D ‚Äì investment in research is very important to explore different battery technologies - Li-ion, fuel cell, Li ‚Äì phosphate. Ambient temperatures of battery is important & India is a hot compared to rest of the world.

Nuclear waste will exist for 100s of thousands of years.

If a solar park is damaged by an earthquake or system breakdown, it will cause relatively little harm - however, when nuclear power plants have accidents the damage to the environment is massive (Chernobyl & Fukishima that is still leaking deadly nuclear waste into the ocean. It should also be noted that there is a massive industry in recycling solar panels very efficiently whose main problem is presently lack of resources because solar panels are lasting much longer than predicted. Also, the rapid exponential improvements in batteries & other storage technologies means that the intermittency challenges of renewable energy sources are less relevant. And then there are the world-changing breakthroughs in local geothermal heating possibilities, which are likely to make most forms of energy manufacture redundant, etc, etc.

In this video, Mr. Shellenberger makes excellent points about the downsides of wind and solar - concerns I have as well.  But I would take a different tact, rather than seemingly eliminating these sources from our toolbox.  Since 2017, the date of the data slide used in the video, solar panels have become much more efficient, as we would expect with innovations over time.  Mr. Shellenberger also does not explore how the expansion of 'roof top' solar for individual users reduces (or, in some cases, eliminates for the individual) power needed from powerplants without the need for additional transmission lines.  Today's panels lose an estimated 12-1/2% of their capacity (approx. 2-1/2% in the initial year and .5% p/year thereafter) over the 20 year period Mr. Shellenberger mentions.  It's not 100%, that's a given, but a 20% reduction over, say, 30 years seems an acceptable return.  As for dumping used panels in 3rd world countries, the solution is easy - stop doing that!

Concerning wind turbines, there are several ways to make the impact on birds less deadly.  The simplest, according to the American Bird Conservancy, is location - choosing areas that are less traversed by birds and bats.  Another way is to make turbines taller and the blades shorter.... and yet another is design.  While vertical axis wind turbines are not as efficient, they do improve the amount of energy generated per square meter and are better seen by birds.

I would also question the need to be 100% 'green', especially in the short term and particularly looking that goal practicality.  The Earth does have natural absorption and storage of greenhouse gasses.

Apropos, more birds ar killed by colliding with the glass and steel skyscrapers of our mega-cities than by wind turbines. Put solar panels on every roof, solar foil on windows, so that no extra land area is needed. There are ever more efficient storage btteries being developed..... Nukes are not the answer.

Electrification of primary energy eliminates horribly inefficient burning of fuel, transport of fuels, multi-step fuel cycle including oil refining‚Äîa huge user of electricity & cobalt (as are other fossil & fissile fuels). That saves 60% of primary energy (direct use of fuels for transportation, industry & buildings). Huge savings beyond that are achievable while reducing costs. Solar & wind are the cheapest sources of energy, even including storage that makes them dispatchable, ie, 24/7. Nukes are the most expensive. 

2:14   Rooftop, parking lot, building-side, window solar require no transmission at all, only connection to the distribution network if that. Reservoir, canal, & other PV sites can be similar. Offshore wind is often near population centers, so requires little transmission, & there are no NIMBOs. FFs & nukes, OTOH, have to be kept far from populations to be [a little] safe[r], so do need massive transmission lines, costs, political fights, often scapegoating poor people of color.

(Even though I think Nuclear is still the way to go.)
He mentioned the size of solar farms, but not the size of Uranium mines which can be huge open pits.  There are other ways, but this is pretty common, and the environment there is also completely wiped out. Of course after the mine is closed, the company can be forced to reclaim the area and it should recover vs a permanent solar or wind farm.
Also, what seems to be misleading is the birds burning.  They don't burn up over photovoltaic solar farms; only the ones that use mirrors to focus the sunlight on a small collector.
Also, I like the idea that cats only kill small common birds, and apparently only large majestic birds like eagles can be endangered or worth caring about.
There are plenty of small species of birds who are endangered and cats are showing to be about the worst invasive species causing several extinctions.
The other question I have is why the desert animals had to be moved to captivity instead of moving them to the area outside the farm, fencing it, then letting them back in under the panels once the construction was done?  I'm just curious  because I would think the shade would make a great habitat if some small vegetation could grow around the panels.",none,,2023-12-02 21:28:20.637168,2.0

There are future iterations of Solar PV panels which may reincorporate toxic elements but that's a discussion that can be had if and when the time comes.

CSP comes in smaller modules that works better. Why?  Heliostats placed too far away from the tower scatters photons so much that a tiny fraction left hit the tower.. If you understand optics, you will know what I mean.. There is a small CSP start up  that has a much smaller CSP design  in 5mw modules  instead of 200 or 500 MW like Ivanpah's.   Ten yrs ago, there was another company that use stirling engines mounted on large dishs of reflecting mirrors  which was promising until photovoltaics plummeted in price.. Customers abandoned them and went for photovoltaics..
Shellenberger skimped on solar energy as unworkable..  Well, photovoltaics has limits but CSP still has further to go.. That small CSP startup  I mentioned above has attained 1000 degree Celsius  or 2700 degree F  with use of artificial intelligience that adjust heliostats 30 times a second..  We still have far more to concentrate sunlight than even now..  Ivanpah was a sloppily designed oversized inefficient CSP. 
People has unreasonable aversity toward mining but they ignore the oilfields which are far worse when it comes to land use.. If you go to Google map or Bing map and use satellite view   to zoom in those oil fields  , you will be surprised at how much land is used to site one single oil well..  it is hard to see those oil wells from satellite, so you have to know where the oil fields are and you zoom in .   I cannot show this to you here , so you have to do it to see for yourself..   Mining last for decades   and it takes up a few square miles that contain tailings, deposit and mill crusher .  Metals are recyclable..  So back to that small CSP start up , they are focused on industrial customers that produce stuff like concrete,  cast metals, or even process food using ovens and huge cooking vats ,etc   still rely on natural gas or electricity  .  Those industrial customers are now looking at that small CSP startup for its very advanced CSP modules. to help cut down carbon emissions.  
People are generally average minded when it comes to cutting edges   .. What we have with renewables , some is good , others not so good. Renewables will still be with us forever..
France which depend on nuclear energy for most of its electricity need are now facing aging reactors that is starting to break down . Nuclear reactors are very hot engines and they requires expensive alloy metals used to mix with steel to make pipes and heat exchangers . Those expensive alloyed steel pipes are showing age already after decades of use.. They are too radioactive to recycle if at all. it is a big mess coming. It is far more than storing minscule amounts of spent yet dangerous nuclear fuel with nowhere safe enough put away.  We will end up having to fast breed those spent nuclear fuel in special reactors  that can blow up more readily than the original reactors.
Nuclear energy is suicidal !   Average minded people dont think about that well ahead in advance.. Nuclear is dead!
 Back to that small CSP startup company,  It offers the best promise still! 
Again, mining is not as bad as average minded people are inclined to believe otherwisely.  I know mining industry for past several decades and they never bother me.. Those deposits  keep on giving and giving for decades and decades    unlike anything else .. I know of..
They last a long time... Renewables requires much more metals , sure,   this is still no big deal!   I urge you to use your favorite online map with satellite view and zoom capability   and  look for oil field locations   .  satellite view will require a lot of internet bandwidth but it is worth your time to go there and zoom in those oil fields.. you will be floored by how huge those fields are around the world..

For example, the widely reported number of 97% of scientists agreeing that humans are responsible for climate change is a lie. Do you know how that number was derived? It‚Äôs based on a 2013 analysis by John Cook of around 12,000 global climate change papers. None were read in full, only the abstract / summary paragraphs were reviewed and then grouped into one of 4 categories:
1. 3,896 papers agreed that humans were to blame for climate change.
2. 7,930 took no position either way.
3. 78 rejected the idea of humans being to blame.
4. 40 we‚Äôre uncertain altogether.
That initial pass gave only 32% stating global warming was down to anthropological activity. Cook‚Äôs team didn‚Äôt think that was anywhere near alarming enough, so the 7,930 papers that held no position either way were removed from the final analysis. This gave a much more ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô result of 97% of papers that now agreed with the desired result of the exercise, which Obama and John Kerry then decided to broadcast as ‚Äò97% of all scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change‚Äô.
This is what ‚Äòthe consensus is that nearly all climate scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change‚Äô is based on.
Ideological and political groups are manipulating the public fear response for their own purposes of control.
Modern environmental data gathering techniques repeatedly demonstrate that the models used for prediction used by environmental groups are over stating the rate of change by around a factor of 2.0-2.5. They additionally underestimate the amount of heat loss from the atmosphere into space by a factor of 6.
CO2 is also demonized as a toxin, yet all plant life on Earth needs it to survive. Forests, jungles and crop harvests are growing and improving world wide.
The only observable potential issue is sea level rise, which has been around 1.9mm per year on average over the last 125 years and is a perfectly manageable rate of change.

That is not the cost in money of a kW hr but the cost in energy. As stated in the video wind and solar can be viewed as diluted energy or low energy density. The essential criteria that determines the ""gain factor"" is energy density and conversion efficiency dispatctable energy for use in society. Renewables have low energy density and low energy conversion efficiency. The opposite is true of fossil fuel, nuclear and hydro. In simpler terms renewables ultimaetely consume more of the energy they produce in sustaining their operation. Thus leaving less for other purposes. The same analysis can applied to agriculture and the two combined describing the true energy envelope or economy. You cannot use money to analyse a purely physical system that actually drives the monetary economy. Humans have lived in a positive energy gain  system albeit low for tens of thousands of years, slowly rising. That is untill agriculture came along and increased the energy gain of the good supply and consequential growth of population. With the advent of windmills and water wheels around 12th century energy gain started to rise exponentially, when turbines started turn alternators around the turn of the 19th century we have the super rise of exponetial growth that has led us to today and 8 billion people. It does seem that the lower gain performance envelope of renewables will cause a negative energy gain system for the first time in human history. Consequently the theory of ""economic"" will not hold true as it was founded  in a positive energy gain system.

The irony to me is that I'm ""just a philosopher,"" yet I've been trying to convey these exact points to other-field ""experts"" for many years, always to be told that ""philosophers aren't experts in any field"" and so dismissed by ""the experts"" in the ""relevant"" fields. How much directional entropy have we developed over the decades of touting renewables that we must now overcome? How much political commitment (and promises made that must be kept) is there that even the (now) ""experts"" are (finally) coming to realize must be overcome?

The problem with intellectual honesty is that most fields actually don't have it. Science in particular is very, very slow to correct its falsified directions/commitments! And most scientists today still believe in the absolutely debunked verificationism codified in the 50s as ""positivism."" This is sold to the public as ""studies show,"" ""science has shown,"" ""follow the science,"" and other such catchy phrases that lead the public (who pays for the research) to believe that science is telling us the ""facts of the universe"" rather than the actual thing it is telling us: ""This is how things seem to work to us at this moment, not taking the various anomalies into account that will perhaps [essentially certainly] end up falsifying our present perspectives/models."" And so, ""predictive results"" stand equivalent to ""metaphysical results,"" when in fact they bear no resemblance to each other.

Meanwhile, the general public is led around by the nose (always paying for it), as we hear ""follow the science,"" yet the vast, VAST majority of people (including the vast majority of scientists themselves) have precisely zero idea what ""science"" even IS.

Don't get me wrong! I'm not a ""science basher."" Far from it! I'll go to an MD over a witch doctor any day of the week! And I'll respect nuclear physics over rubbing sticks together to see what might happen any day of the week! Science gets us microwave ovens and space shuttles that don't blow up most of the time. But it's NOT doing metaphysics, which, unfortunately, is how science is marketed to the public that pays for it. So, science (and how its results are marketed) should be MUCH less strident and confident in its theories and results; and that means it should be MUCH less culpable in even obliquely FORCING people to ""follow the science"" or be considered a quaint whack job!

It's absolutely incorrect to say, ""There's much that science doesn't yet know."" It is instead accurate to say, ""There is nothing that science knows... unless you are deflating the value of the word 'know' quite significantly."" Even the idea that ""the best evidence"" is summed up by the present slate of ""scientific knowledge"" is giving empirical ""knowledge"" itself far too much credit. And this present video just scratches the surface of making that very point!

There is NO knowledge that is not rife with interpretation and a pre-existing web of beliefs that have more or less justification for each thread of that complex web. The problem with ""national science"" and ""follow the science"" is that those phrases ""justify"" (falsely so-called) forming national policy (and exercising force against dissenters) on the basis of whatever a present group of ""experts"" happen to believe at the moment. And, as we are now finally starting to discover in the subject of this very video, distinguishing preferences and politics from the ACTUAL science is essentially impossible! Even who are counted as the ""experts"" is so laden with interpretation and the foibles of the scientific method itself, not to mention preferences, cronyism, and politics, that the whole mess becomes a self-replicating monster at the national level.

You'd think that we would eventually learn from our perpetually-repeated mistake. But, as I led with, intellectual honesty is a very rare character attribute!",none,,2023-12-02 21:28:20.796001,0.0

These misleading comparisons are troubling and they undermine the whole presentation.

And the less increase in cost is also reached by just limiting the increase by law and paid for by taxes, which Germany doesn't do.

If we had invested in nuclear in Germany in the last decade, we wouldn't have any increase in available energy, because in this timeframe we wouldn't have built a single new nuclear plant, much less got any surplus energy from it.

Even worse, we would still have the same and worse dependence on foreign states (like Russia), maybe (again) competing with France about colonies in Africa.
Additional, we don't have any radioactive waste repositories, and if we - like any other producer of nuclear waste - starts competing for storage capacity in a single location in Switzerland or maybe the future ones in Finnland, the prices for that service will also rise.
Even now, nuclear power in Germany is extremely expensive, because we always placed high priority in safety, while solar is way cheaper.

Your analysis of solar may the correct for those photothermic liquid salt plants, but you can place photovoltaic (and in some places photothermic panels on a white array of dead space, like parking lots, houses, facades, even farmland when you're growing shade loving crops, so there are workarounds.
So there's a lot of new technology still unexplored.

I also doubt the kill score of wind plants concerning birds, seeing how the same animals are able to catch smaller birds in aerial dogfights and how slow and constant the wings of windmills are moving.
Furthermore, it doesn't fit my observations in the time I lived near those.
The populations of birds are dropping dramatically since long before any noticeable amount of Wind energy plants were built; suspects range from loss of breeding places, contamination of food and prey with metals, insecticides, fungicides, GMOs and disturbances by farming machines. 
And here too are possible ways to mitigate the damage, like smaller windmills for single households, fitting the wings with lights of reflectors or even whistles.

Even the very real problems some grids have with renewables, these problems are less important if you live off-grid or have only a small community to supply, where you can simply disconnect the water/wind/solar and start your biogas driven emergency generator (or just don't use electricity during that time).

So while you're right in dismissing some of the hopes from the early days of renewables, we shouldn't discount the possibilities recent developments could bring.

And we should not ignore the biggest and cheapest form of energy: energy saving!
Blockchains are a huge waste of energy, similar to commuting for a lot of jobs, planned obsolescence, not to mention wars in any form.
 
While nuclear still has the same problems as 40 years ago, and the promised ""new"" technologies are still decades away from commercial viability, even when they are decades old.
Go for research, yes, but don't bet the future on the stuff dreams are made of, and which can't be scaled down to small and harmless experimental units (RTGs in every cellar).",none,,2023-12-02 21:28:21.021102,1.0

Nuclear is far too expensive and takes too long to build (25 years is usual). No discussion here of emissions from gas, and the arguments re land use from solar are just a joke.  Far more land used for coal fired plants and coal mines (including waste material). Water use (coal and nuclear) also not mentioned. Currently, French nuclear power seriously constrained due to lack of water in French rivers.
Already, the Australian grid is moving rapidly to fully renewable, with all coal fired plants gone no later than 2035. Solar (including massive home solar uptake), wind, pumped hydro and batteries are taking over, making fossil fuels (and nuclear) totally uneconomic.
During summer here, the cost of electricity supplied to the grid sometimes goes negative!, and power utilities that rip off customers will just drive more home solar adoption.

I can get a 3100 kWh system on my roof for ¬£5500 which would half my electricity costs at current prices and pay itself in just 4 years!

The best current method is to bury it deep in the ground for just 10,000 years lol And lastly nuclear power can be really expensive. We've just had Sizewell C built in the UK and the costs of electricity produced are way way higher than was originally anticipated. The strike price adjusted for inflation is currently ¬£120MWh. How is that cheaper than the current average for wind at ¬£50MWh? And the predictions are that wind will be subsidy free within a couple of years.

MS seems to have missed the battery conversation by quite a margin, maybe 3 years is a big jump, but ....
ALL energy generation technologies require mining commodity of one kind or another
Nuclear is still the heaviest subsidized power source , followed by fossil-fuels - yes, i know that's not what the official story is but those are govt stats
Then there's the catastrophic failure thing with Nuclear ...... so there's that too
Then there's the 'shorter transmission lines ' thing - put your hands up who wants a Nuclear power station next door to the school YOUR kids go to......
There are quite a few coal-fired stations that have reduced emissions by 'running less' when the nearby solar & wind farm supplies daylight-hours power 
They use large batteries to manage the (now instantaneous) transition from renewables to coal-fired energy gen.


No big deal
No one really expects societies to switch off fossil-energy at 3pm on Tuesday.
This is foolishness, that fossil-lobby paid stooges promote
The Energy and Utilities suppliers will ALL tell you that renewables are already cheaper and easier to manage than load-sharing with fossil-fuel energy generation

I looked online and found that the average price from Tesla for a replacement battery pack cost between $13K-$14K. That means if I go out and find a 2012 or 2013 Model S for sale preowned for about $25K-$30K that is on the verge of needing a new battery pack and a short period of time after purchasing the car the battery pack fails, I would be out of another $13K-$14K for a new battery pack on top of what I paid or financed for the price of the car. I would burn that stupid car in the street and claim it as a insurance lost vs fixing it. I think if manufacturers want us or force us the consumers to go green then there should be a lifetime warranty on the the battery pack. I believe if EV vehicles help the environment as much as the experts state then why should we have to pay for a new battery pack if I was driving a ""green"" vehicle and it's good for the environment? Maybe there can be a future federal law passed or a rebate of some sort to where if the battery pack does go bad then the owner would only pay the labor for the needed repairs or a reduced price vs the current price. I would definitely consider going green if some of these service were reduced, but I refuse to spend that amount of money on a car to where after years of owing it I would be better off buying a whole different car for the amount of a replacement battery pack. That is one topic I wish was covered in this video.

1. Have you considered where a parking lot of 5000 cars at a typical company are going to all charge up?
2. Who is going to foot the bill for all of these charging stations, plus the added infrastructure to support the increased electrical demand?
3. How many nuclear plants are on the drawing board to supplement the increased demand?  Oh, forgot, nuclear is dangerous. Well, lets build coal or natural gas plants...uh , forgot, they are not green and too much fracking to get the gas.
4. What about people living in apartments with no garage, or multi-car families? What is the cost to install a rapid charging station that will reach each vehicle?  Charging on 110v not really practical, nor is using an extension cord to connect to all of your families cars, or waiting 2 hrs to charge. Remember, more young people stay with parents now since they can't afford their own home.
5, And what about locations with extremely cold winters?  Have you seen the effect of cold weather on batteries?

Electric cars are just a ""fad"" for the stupid progressives right now because they don't know anything about logistics to support any technological change.  And don't just say , ""Well, the government with do all this support with our tax dollars.""   Yeh, lets sink more money into that $27 trillion dollar hole!  

Maybe not as popular, but Hydrogen gas powered cars seems like the most viable solution at the moment, with quick fill-ups like petrol stations and short refill times.
But this is the generation that have an orgasm every time Elon Musk tweets some stupid s#%^&, or drive up their credit cards to the max on $1000 iphones, or purchase homes worth 7 times their yearly salary and expect tax payers to bail them out when they start to go under.

Yea, but I got the ICE car for half the price, I can work on that car inside out, I don't need to worry about the range decreasing nor do I need to wait to top it up when doing large distances. 

Still, the ICE car is more affordable for me.

It would also take me over 10 years to save anything by driving BEV and by then the battery is on it's way out. They also raise electricity costs.

There are other reasons too like no true V8 sound (not being put through speakers, that's just lame) and hydrogen fuel cells will become more common and they address the problems of batteries. Right now they are not an efficient energy source for vehicles.",none,,2023-12-02 21:28:34.693693,0.0

In gas powered vehicles it's a matter of 5 minutes only.
The battery cost is still high I think. The Battery has to be replaced after every 2-3 years or the battery will be unable to keep up the range that is expected. The electricity to help the Evs to be charged has to be humongous in amount and that will also create pollution.

They have to buy new equipment and tools too for servicing these cars. As long as they are making money selling ICE cars, they are not gonna try selling something else.
3. Range anxiety is not an issue, It's just same as how big your fuel tank is. Consumers are more concerned about charging time. A three lane gas station can service 30 cars in minutes, Imagine having same number of cars at a 6 slot charging station.

First, you must be in the small category of people who purchase their vehicles new.  Throughout my fifty year driving career, I have never purchased a NEW vehicle, always purchased used.  Would you purchase a used (5 year old) Chevy VOLT that has only 3 to 5 years left of battery life and knowing that a 32 cent diode failure could render the vehicle useless?  In most cases,  those shopping for an EV are homeowners, who have a dedicated driveway or garage for overnight parking and charging.  Your home electrical panel will require costly modifications and charging equipment to allow the vehicle to be trickle charged overnight and more costly to ""quick charge"" from your home.  It is not reasonable to own an electric vehicle if you need to rely on the limited number of quick charging stations that are currently available .   Throughout Toronto, for example, there are many, many thousands of vehicles that rely on overnight street parking without a dedicated parking spot.  On night you manage to park in front of your house, the next night you park in front of your neighbour's house six doors down and the next night you park around the corner on the next block.  If fifty percent of all vehicles today were EVs and they all plugged in overnight, the Ontario power grid would come crashing down.  We already suffer blackouts and brownouts during hot summer months when home air conditioning units are running.  The upgrades to the electrical grid to support electric vehicles will not be cheap and the cost of electricity,  which we use for a multitude of purposes, is going to sky rocket.  The future savings of operating an electric vehicle are very questionable.   Conversion to electric vehicles can certainly provide an enormous benefit to the environment, but only if very strategic smart planning is managed between the competing energy sectors and all levels of government.....but, When did you last see that happen?",none,,2023-12-02 21:28:34.694873,0.0

1) Range (anxiety?). When/If I go pure EV I want something with 400 miles or more or range, even if most of my driving is 50 miles or less.
2) Time to charge. I can handle 30 minutes or so to get most of my charge, but most of the time it looks like we're talking about an hour or more ‚Äì IF you're talking about a higher end charger. Most other places allow for topping off type charges, if that.
3) Access to charging. If I want to visit relations in northeast Iowa or northern Lower Michigan, I don't want to have to worry about driving an hour or so to the nearest charger (next to an interstate, of course) to fully recharge my vehicle...nor do I want to nurse what charge I have (between top off style charges) if I spend a week in and around NE Iowa (which is the present situation).
4) I rent an apartment without garages, so I can't recharge overnight while I sleep. There is a limited amount of access to chargers where I live. Even if EV chargers won't be as ubiquitous as gas stations are nowadays (which I understand fully ‚Äì if you can charge at home, you'll happily charge at home), they need to be around for travelers, people on a night out, commuters and those of us without direct access to charging.
5: Today's EVs are designed to stand out. From what I can see the Korean EVs are the only EVs (outside the Rivian, and they sort of push the envelope) that look like a normal vehicle at first glance. I wish to see more EV that don't stand out from regular cars (of course, the EV style may end up winning out. I just don't see THAT happening as of right now).

Now, I believe that EVs are the future. I just don't believe the future is quite here yet, and if that means I'm late to the party so be it ‚Äì at least the EV tech will be worked out by then.",none,,2023-12-02 21:28:34.694977,0.0

The main issue for me, apart from the price and lack of charging infrastructure, is rapidly changing and improving technology. If you buy an EV now, it will most likely be outdated in a couple of years (much like a smartphone) and you'll wish you'd waited for the newer model. Entirely new types of batteries are in the pipeline and are coming out in the next few years, including at Tesla and Toyota. These will make Li-Ion powered EVs obsolete and crude overnight, making them pretty much worthless.

Second new batery tech is coming  mAking 325 range a snap, and rendering resale of today s car impossible. In the next 4-5 years,In other word if you buy right now you will be stuck with your car nobody will want it.
Third price of batteries will continu to drop as they become more powerful because many more people will buy electric cars, therefore the price of cars will drop and even though the car makers will want to jack up the price competion will prevent it.
Right now people who buy electric cars probably have a second gas car or simply are dazzled by the new technology they dont save the environment and they dont save any money as a mater of fact they are loosing money. And that is why smart people are waiting.",none,,2023-12-02 21:28:34.882892,0.0

I think, that we will be driving the gasoline/diesel fueled car a long time yet. Why?  The electric car  is having the range  when  driving with the constant speed: the car  acceleration will  rise the temperature of battery  and diminishing the range . The same when you are houling other car.  The substances in the battery are flammable, explosive in mixture with the air , toxic and cancerogenic and the battery is  occupying whole  bottom part of this car. The car exident in this case is much more dangerous than the petrol fueled car:  ambulance, police, fireman and the chemical  fire fighting team to be present, procedure of cleaning more costly . Price of this car is  high and the metals  used for this would be  in deficiency of supply if everybody will wish to buy it. And the risk of environmental pollutikon will be seriously incereased. In case of war I do not see it for tanks, warships, airplanes , especially fighters, vertical start planes. I think, that this option is currently agressively and excessively forced in propaganda- and from this reason  it will find some ""ecological niche"" - but the petrol/kerosine/diesel will remain  the base of used fuels.

I would absolutely consider one if it was financially viable, as the technology is superior in nearly every way (imo). But with that much of a difference in price while going backwards in comfort it isn't worth it yet.

real-world reasons why BC residents don't buy electric cars. Please follow
along.¬† It's not range anxiety, it's true
lack of range. The E-Golf is the most attractive, affordable, normal looking
and natural EV car, and it has an estimated range of 201 km under ideal
conditions.¬† In Canada, with heaters,
wipers, headlights always on through the winter, and then non low rolling resistance
winter tires, that could easily drop to 150 km or less. That is unacceptable.
The Hyundai Kona and other Megatron looking EV cars have marginally more range,
with a hefty price increase.¬† The most
cost-effective Tesla is the 3, standard battery rear wheel drive. It is the
only Model 3 with BC government incentives. Wait though... In a vast province
like BC, with 6 months of winter, the only 3 to receive a rebate is the rear
wheel drive, short range battery?¬† Seems
backwards.¬† It continues.. Follow
along.¬† SUV‚Äôs and Pickups are the hottest
selling vehicles in North America, and by far the most popular in BC. We camp,
we fish, we mountain bike and live life like the Beautiful BC advertisements on
TV. ¬†We have one SUV to choose from, the
Tesla Model X. It‚Äôs north of $100,000 and is a slightly raised blimpy car. Now
comes battery degradation. It‚Äôs been proven so far that electric cars lose 1-2%
of battery capacity for every 10,000 km. Following that trend, at 120,000 we
could potentially have only 60% of our original capacity? That E-Golf is now good
for‚Ä¶ 70 km to a charge, real world driving? ¬†Right. ¬†Now on the other hand is depreciation. The
Chevrolet Volt and Bolt have the lowest resale value of any car in Chevrolets
lineup. In fact, EV‚Äôs in general have some of the greatest depreciation of any
car sold today.¬† Technology is increasing
by leaps and bounds, a 5 year old EV will be completely outdated and useless. Much
like the introduction of the computer, we‚Äôre in the age where the electric car
is getting better year by year. Considering that most Mazda 3‚Äôs, VW Jetta TDI‚Äôs
and similar economical cars already achieve 40 mpg‚Ä¶ That is upwards of 650km to
35 liters. Those cars are nearly half the price of a Model 3. When you break
out the increased cost of the EV, increased depreciation and more difficult
sometimes painful recharging situation, it‚Äôs clear. The EV has a long ways to
come. Canadians are thrifty and all about convenience. We won‚Äôt jump on board
until EV‚Äôs are cheaper, offer more range, and fewer drawbacks. There are a few real world reasons why people
don't buy electric cars. Please follow along.¬† It's not range anxiety,

Believe it or not its true BEV are up there with unregulated track vehicles for damadges to the environment.

How can I claim this easy, I have yet to be provided one these studies that factors the disposal/recycling of the 1,000 lbs of lithium every 220,000 km (136,701miles).

Literally the last study I debunked was telling end users to use, that 1000+lbs of volatile lithium as paper weights or to store in your basement, serious over sight lithium spontaneously combusts when wet or punctured.

So Teslas
-Cost more
-Are worse environment overall. 
-Don't work well in winter + cold damadges the batteries
-3x higer odds of burning to death, despite being less likely to catch fire (don't get wet for best results)
-Higher chance to get stranded
-limited changing station
-higher operating costs.
yes charging is cheaper but a new battries for BEV are not cheap lithium is one of the rarest metals on the earth and just this year lithium hit $16usf per kilo x 540 (1200lbs modle S) is $8,640 usd in raw lithium alone. Factor making the batteries and replacing them, now your looking at $24,000Usd evey 3-4 years (less in winter climate)

Furthermore, if you do purchase additional coverage (which is not legally required), there can be no claim made on your additional coverage until the car rental company's coverage is exhausted. That's why it's called ""primary"". I have even been lied to at the time of renting a car, as the rep told me that they don't insure there cars. Interestingly enough, when I sat down in the car I had just rented (and didn't insure), I saw a sticker on the windshield indicating the companies self-insurance (which is insurance) administrator service that I need to contact if I was involved in an accident.

If you have Costco- USE IT. They have great discounts!

Hit up those weekend specials that go from Friday-Monday. They are as low at $17.99 a day but most of the time they do have mileage caps.

Always POLITELY ask for a discount. Personally in my branch when you nicely ask we‚Äôll at least throw on a 5-15% discount ;)

Another huge tip that A LOT of people don‚Äôt think about is if you live in a city with multiple of the same car rental branches, search for the best price then transfer it.
For example, say I live in Atlanta and there are 18 Enterprise‚Äôs in the city. Not all will have the same priced rentals. So I will book my rental at the branch with the lowest price. Then I will call the branch I WANT to pick it up from and get them to transfer that reservation from the other branch to that branch and the price will hold. :)",none,,2023-12-02 21:28:42.011289,3.0

Reason given was electric cars cost considerably more to repair if it's going into a a oven for painting the battery has to be removed ect ect . But the main factor all electric cars where put into the same bracketing and tesla's had the biggest effect on premiums lack of specialists who could repair them so waiting times car hire ect sored even some car's having to go to norway for  repairs .

You raise some good points, some of which are not entirely accurate. I like the way you looked at risk comparing the EV and Petrol counterparts stating that your not comparing like for like or ""apples to apples"". However, whilst comparing list prices with list prices, remember that these vehicles devalue at different rates. My understanding is that typically, EV's devalue faster than ICE vehicles. You'd be hard pressed to find an insurer who will replace your vehicle with a list priced brand new car after a total loss claim once the car is more than six months old, although, you can purchase GAP insurance to cover this.

Whilst you are right in stating that the LV policy seems like some fluffy marketing to sell more insurance to EV owners (things like this happen all the time), there are potential benefits from the policy given your points raised (please note, I am not an employee of LV or associated with LV). For example, your point about the household insurance and the wall box being covered by it. This assumes that there is a household policy in place to cover the wall box. My wall box is outside and some HH insurers may exclude cover for contents which are permanently outside. It's also my understanding that more people insure their pets than they insure their homes (which is bonkers but that might be because I'm a cold hearted insurance broker by trade). Also, whilst you may pay ¬£150 to replace your wall box and do it yourself, I wouldn't. I know hardly anything about electrics so I would pay an electrician to come out and replace it. Granted, this maybe a minimum cost of ¬£60 which would still fall under an assumed excess of ¬£250 (my excess is ¬£150 on my car), due to my circumstances, the cost to install my car charging setup was over ¬£800 (my circumstances are not typical and it took about 6 hours to install by a qualified electrician). Also, if your already claiming on car insurance, a lot of which come with protected no claims discount, why would you claim on household insurance for the wall box?

If you wanted to into more detail, I'd be happy to discuss this with you.",none,,2023-12-02 21:28:51.063950,3.0

I had an incident with my i3 and they handled the claim well (although my renewal was more expensive than it had been  and annoyingly I hadn't paid the extra for a hire car so had to hire one myself).

However I agree completely that the special features for electric vehicles aren't special. Here's the description for the optional extra electric hire car. Oh no, it's ""Electric or hybrid"", nope it's ""Electric or hybrid (if available)"", but you can't get an electric hire car for love or money, so if you have to claim on this you can be pretty sure it won't be electric. What's a 2 litre electric car anyway?

Electric or hybrid hire car cover

This use of an electric or hybrid hire car (if available) if your own car is being repaired by our recommended repairer service, or has been stolen or written off.

For ¬£19.90¬†per year, you're guaranteed a small hatchback hire car.

For ¬£29.90¬†per year, you're guaranteed a similar sized hire car to your own. This could be a car with up to seven seats and have a maximum engine size of 2 litres.",none,,2023-12-02 21:28:51.382918,0.0

The expense to retrofit an apartment building to accommodate an EV at every apartment would be terribly expensive and just isn't going to happen..",none,,2023-12-02 21:29:00.775377,2.0

So
Oil protects $200Billion per MONTH by posting about 400 FUD articles per MONTH

When does the transmission go out? Automatic transmission job is $2,300 and a clutch for a manual is $1,600. I think if the payment is lower for a lease, go that route unless you find a car you want to work on. Anything made after 2005 for me it is more worth to me to pay to have it fixed vs doing it myself. I find an exception to that rule for a few select vehicles. Now that is if you have a handyman in the house. If you dont, I think leasing may be the way to go especially if you dont have any experience with cars.

BUT if you were to go in and negotiate the lease down a little bit to maybe $100 less per month or have them waive some of the tacked on fees because you are giving them such incredible business by leasing a car for $46500 over 3 years you could easily knock $10,000 off the sticker price of the car and pay no interest for 3 full years on the vehicle all while saving up that cash to purchase it outright if you so choose at the end of your lease. I know what you're thinking, surely the car must have depreciated to a price lower than that of what the end of the lease purchase price is. You're wrong, a 2017 AMG GT right now will cost you around $75k-$80k on the used market with comparable mileage to what your end lease mileage would be. All in all you'd be saving yourself a ton of money by leasing this car to buy, this can be said for quite a few of the other performance sports luxury cars out there as well and even some supercars. If you take the time to dig into the financial details you will find a way to make the system work for you!",none,,2023-12-02 21:29:09.661826,0.0

A minor scrape becomes a major nightmare.  If you fix it, and don't tell your lease holder, then it costs lots of money, and likely won't be undetectable (leaseholder will find it, and tack on a fee at the end).  If you don't fix it, then it might rust and the lease holder will assess even more than what it might cost to fix today.  And if you tell the lease holder, they will punish you twice by giving you the option of ""letting"" them fix it (at stealership rates), or roll the dice on the above fix/or no fix.  Either way, they know the damage was done so they will be adding a fee at the end, no matter what.  So the only ""smart"" choice is to make sure you get it fixed so well that nobody can tell (impossible..?), and hope to avoid detection.

Leasing also protects you from negative equity and depreciation. The way you maintain your car is unlikely to change whether you lease or buy so it's smarter to make any overlooked repairs the problem of the manufacturer. If you have the credit for it and aren't under extreme budget constraints, I'll suggest a no down payment lease including all your taxes and fees rolled in. Give or take, it's an average of an additional 50bucks or less in monthly payment but protects you from losing your down payment in the scenario of a total loss etc. Understand your driving habits in terms of mileage so you can negotiate the right miles upfront so you don't go over and pay penalties OR feel restricted while leasing the car.

Buying is really for those who have no real desire to swap cars often especially not in 3years and have the means to pay a higher monthly payment. In order to maintain the value of the car as close to the desired value as possible, it requires meticulous maintenance routine and record keeping as well as the willingness to sell a car as a private party. Additionally, you have to be willing to assume the risks of being liable for any after-purchase issues and the buyer potentially knowing where you live, work or who you are in order to complete the sale. Financially, any equity you have in buying a car is at constant risk of depreciation due to market forces like public perception of the car, unforeseen issues that may arise after the purchase ie recalls, faulty parts and design, popularity of the model or the vehicles sales performance after release etc. In the current era of frequently updated body styles and models, the appetite for one model becoming a classic or even desirable is very low because manufacturers are constantly updating vehicles with new technology in order to make the new models sellable and appealing. From experience in the industry, buying has to be the choice of very decisive people who are extremely certain of keeping the car for a minimum of 5years in order for it to payoff. Meaning you can use it as a bad form of savings in case you need cash from a physical property you own. 

There's more to it than what I've explained above but for all intents and purposes, and from my experience in the industry, leasing is the superior choice financially.",none,,2023-12-02 21:29:09.662609,0.0

In leasing, you have significantly more cashflow per month that can pay off other debt, save, invest, etc. 
When you buy a car and finance, you might save money after 5-6 years after the car is paid off, but until then, it‚Äôs more expensive each month. 
After 3 years, you have a payment but no warranty, worst of both worlds. 
Sure, with a lease you have to pay a down payment every 3 years, but after 3 years, the maintenance costs go up to $2000/year, exceeding the cost of a lease down payment every 3 years. 
Also, after 6 years when you finally start saving a little money per month over leasing, your car is less and less reliable every day, which is s huge factor to consider. 
Though your payment is gone, 6+ years old cars have higher maintenance costs, about $3500/year or $292/mo!! That means it‚Äôs not much cheaper than leasing!
The only good thing about buying is after 5-6 years you likely have equity in the car and can trade it in to reduce your next 5-6 years of payments. 
But that also means having continuous payments just like a lease.

(If you live in a state with no sales tax (there's a handful), then you lose that advantage of course.)
2.)  Subvented Rates.  In the scenario where 0% financing is offered, you are correct that for a Buy, the low APR is in lieu of rebates, so you're essentially losing the rebate to take advantage of the 0%.  In Leases, however, that is not the case, the Rebates on a lease are in conjunction with any low money factor (lease equivalent of an APR).

You also put the ""Buy"" at 36 Months, when anything under 60 months is incredibly rare.  A fairer comparison would be to make the buy for 60 Months, and then make the Lease for 36 Months, plus finance the Residual for the last 24 Months (and bump the residual finance rate up a bit since you're financing a used car at that point).  I realize that would make for a more complex video, so I can appreciate sticking to the simpler scenario.

Problem is 95% of the country lives on a monthly budget.  So you take on a bigger monthly payment to buy a vehicle, typically NOT for 3 years...USUALLY 5 for most average people.  For an average active family, that car is probably gonna see 20k miles a year.  So at the end of 5 years, after paying WAY MORE in interest, what do you have? A vehicle with around 100,000 miles, WAY MORE if you bought the car used.  What's that car really going to be worth at that point?  Well that value only benefits you if you plan on trading it in and BUYING ANOTHER CAR, and signing up for ANOTHER 5 years of payments.  If you keep that car for years afterward (which is where the benefit is supposed to be),  it will eventually be worth almost nothing, and you are back at square 1.

Your lease payment is mostly comprised of depreciation and interest which is the rent charge or finance fee.  It is still a loan, and the bank is going to charge you for the use of their money.

But while going to buy or sell your used vehicle, you should have so many options from where to get vehicle history report.
There are few providers who provide for free report with very basic details and few providers come with full history of a used vehicle with different prices.
Keep in mind, Car history report scam is happening due to the lack of knowledge regarding the vehicle history report amongst both buyers as well as sellers. Every buyers & sellers should know about the details of VIN Check (vehicle history report) and from where to buy it securely & legitimately, which will result in such type of no scam.

First of all if you lease a luxury brand like a BMW, the terms of the lease require you to maintain it and they are going to know if you haven't maintained it. Other brands might or might not be the same. You can't just say I'm gonna lease because I don't like having to maintain cars. Scheduled maintenance may be included but you still have to do it. Second of all, a bigger problem is that when a lease is up, you're under pressure to do something with the car. It may be a bad time for you to do that. You might be busy or you might be short on funds or you might be waiting for the newer model. They may let you continue leasing month to month but if you go back into that dealership they're going to know you need to do something because your lease is up. You don't have as much leverage. Third, insurance is higher if you lease. Fourth, you can refinance your car loan. I had a 4.25% rate which was low for 2nd quarter 2019 but 1st quarter 2020, my credit union had a 0.9% offer. Fifth, you're stuck with the car. Ever have buyer's remorse? I have. In December 2018, I bought a truck. Decided it wasn't for me. I really didn't like it at all. 6 months later I sold it for an $800 profit. And this was a new truck mind you.

What about sales tax and that 4.22% interest rate you pay on the car every month? What if the monthly is $600. Lease payments usually stay consistent. Third, you are using the best case scenario car for your example. Toyota's are known for not depreciating in value (still not going to get 12K though).

But I do acknowledge this as okay advice for many people. Let's assume for this example the rising cost of your lease during years 3 to 10 equal that of the inevitable rising maintenance costs of the vehicle during years 3 to 10.


10yr lifecycle cost buy: $465 for 3 yrs, $0 for 7 yrs per month. Assume $2000 salvage value of vehicle at yr 10. At yr 3 shift $465 to investment fund, assume 5% interest. Vehicle Cost of Ownership = $15,700, Investment Earnings = $31,230.87. Total portfolio = $15,530.87

10yr lifecycle cost to lease: $159 for 10 yrs. No salvage value. At year zero begin investing, $306 per month, 5% interest. Vehicle Cost of Ownership = $19,080, Investment Earnings = $47,235.13. Total Portfolio = $28,155.13

One method is to lock it out, disepate the stored energy, waiting a designated period of time, and then recheck to see if energy has leaked into the system. Other methods include gauges that allow visual observation, or installing or cutting in check valves with low pressure settings (ex. 1/10 the required pressure to operate the machinery).",none,,2023-12-02 21:29:10.614990,2.0

Their brand name is associated with electric cars, and none of the other automakers are, hence if you want an EV, your first stop will be looking at Tesla cars. In the same vein, if Tesla tried to make an ICE car no one would buy it, because Tesla's brand name is EV's, people wouldn't trust that Tesla has the expertise to make a good ICE car.



I think the big problem with the other automakers that's hurting their EV sales is they're in a lose/lose situation with EV's at the moment. EV's are still so new that most people don't realize all the benefits (like lower maintenance costs, how easy it is to charge up at home, how many publicly available chargers there are for long road trips). Ironically the lack of advertising by Tesla to educate the public about the advantages of EV's over ICE cars is probably one of the things HURTING other automakers EV sales. 



The big automakers with ICE cars associated to their brand need to advertise the benefits of EV's to the public to sell their EV's, and convince the public to go to them instead of Tesla. BUT if they tell people how great EV's are and how much ICE cars suck they'll be hurting the sales of all their ICE cars. The transition from ICE to EV's will be painful for the legacy automakers because of this tricky balancing act. 



The worst part about it for the other automakers is Tesla has so much demand that it would be pointless for them to spend money on advertising right now, they're already selling cars faster then they can make them.",none,,2023-12-02 21:29:22.824322,2.0

Can so many batteries be charged immediately and in just few minutes every day , can so many power generation plants supply enough power to make the general public utility grid stable or empty .
Very important is this topic.
Please share with your friends.
Dear friends,
I think 100% people don't know the practical applications on grid .
Please understand what is the every day grid transmission , what is the actual traffic on the grid on peak hours and off peak hours .
How much electricity is required for water pumping applications , how much electricity is required for commercial purposes and industrial applications.
Like this if we consider each sector and it's peak and off peak hours total requirements.
What is the total power generation and distribution one should understand.
In India the per hour power generation is 317000 MW and in India there are minimum 100000 petrol pump outlets on pan India basis or in 28 states and 8 union  territories and in India there are 230000000 vehicles running on roads and registered in RTO'S of India.
If we consider each one individual petrol pump or outlet with a minimum storage capacity of 20000 litres of diesel or petrol then each one litre will have only 3 kWh or units of energy stored.
So each petrol pump has 60000 kWh or units stored energy or 60 MW stored energy.
Total petrol pumps outlets are 100000 and each petrol pump has 60 MW stored energy then it will be 6000000 MW of energy supplied to these 23000000 vehicles running every day on the Indian roads so where is the energy or electricity to supply for these many vehicles.
If each vehicle battery is charged with in 35 seconds then where is the electricity generation.
How can grid function on this sudden imbalance and over balancing of the sudden requirements from various sectors.
Please understand this generation and distribution or transmission and where are the extra lines to take the extra load .

Dear sir greetings,
Story of India.
India is having 78000 petrol pumps outlets and are selling petrol and diesel and gas and each petrol pump has a 20000 litres of liquid per bunk and this is having 60 MW energy.
So India requirement is 5000000 MW of energy.
Please understand this ground realities.
 230 million vehicles on Indian roads
 1 million is 1000000
 230000000 vehicles
 If each vehicle gets minimum 5 kWh or 5 units charge then per hour India needs 
23 00 00 000 vehicles X 5 kWh or units
 1150000000 kWh or units per hour
 1150000000 kWh or units per hour if each unit is sold for 10 rupees
 11500000000 rupees revenue generated
 100740000000000 rupees per year
This is the revenue generated per year
Sir these are genuine figures
 On ground reality
If we convert this to hydrogen then please think about the ground realities
 Please understand the importance and value of the flywheel technology and invention
 I am the only person to work on Flywheel power generation technology and Flywheel power storage technologies
I am the only person to work on power Multipliction technologies
 I am using hydraulic applications pneumatic applications batteries operated motors in-pipe cascading power generation technology etc for power storage and power generation and power Multipliction
I have sent to mukesh ji , like this I have sent to all important people in India
I am doing my marketing and advertising and branding
I am open to all people of the world

HYDROGEN story 
From where can India get the input electricity for making hydrogen
Where is the water , where is the input electricity. Can any one answer?
For an input of 100 kw only 70kw is coming
So for 1000 kw requirements how much energy is spent
1428 kWh spent and 1000 received
So my question is from where can they get this energy
This is just for 1 truck energy requirements per 500 km run
India is having total 23 crore vehicles running on Indian roads
 Out of this half are trucks ,buses
So how can we get so much of input energy
For storage , transportation and distribution how much more energy is required
In the bus sector :- 
In India there are 350000 busses and if each bus gets an investment of 1428 kw then 350000 busses should get 1428 kw investment per each one individual bus = 499800000 kwh electricity per every single charge so if we convert this into MW then 499800 MW per every charge .
AND
For rest of the TRUCKS please think out of 100000000 trucks registered with Indian RTO from 28 states and 8 Union Territories.

Please think what best can be the real time situations.

*Germany ""dominates"" the auto industry. Provably false. While it is true that Volkswagen is the #1 manufacturer, it is almost entirely due to acquisitions and mergers in the past 10 years. Ford was the largest car company during the first 20 years of the auto revolution, GM overtook it and remained #1 for the next 80 years, and then Toyota became the largest for most of the past decade. In any case, Germany has NEVER ranked #1 in production. China currently is the largest, with 25,000,000 autos made in 2020. The US is second with almost 9,000,000 in 2020. Japan is third with 8,000,000 in 2020. Germany's production was less than 4,000,000. The US was the largest manufacturer of autos for most of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st. Japan was #1 in production for a number of years in the mid-1980's to mid-1990's. Neither ever came close to China's record of almost 30,000,000 produced in 2017. 
*The video appears to suggest that Germany is the leader of auto technology. Provably untrue. GM, Toyota, Ford, and Honda are the top 4 companies with the largest technology patent portfolios in force globally. In 2019, both GM and Toyota patented over 1,000 new inventions each. US firms are the patent leaders in driverless, self-parking, camera, remote start, and power accessory technologies. 
*German cars are ""perfect"" and/or ""perfectly"" engineered. A ludicrous claim. Nothing human beings do is ever 100% perfect all the time. 
*No one else comes close to Germany's auto industry. Did he REALLY state that?? In what way does he mean? Size? Quality? Durability? Performance? Car companies usually cannot do all of those at once! It is very difficult to build a ""durable"" supercar or a ""luxury"" SUV that is also very tough. If judging durability, Germany  is not the leader. Japanese, American, and Korean cars outrank European makes overall in durability survey's. If judging performance, Germany stakes a major claim. But it's not invincible. The US also makes supercars that have beaten European models on their own tracks and also have made the fastest SUV's and trucks in recent years. If judging quality, a good claim can be made that German cars are among the best. Are they better than a Rolls Royce? Rolls still commands a higher prestige it seems. Cadillac, though it has been tarnished over the years, currently provides the only real competition to BMW luxury-performance hybrids with similar statistics. Amazingly, the best selling sports car in the world is not German or Japanese. The Ford Mustang continues to command an aura worldwide and is the #1 seller. The Corvette also thrills people globally. As far as countries go, the US builds the largest VARIETY of autos. It has almost 20 automobile manufacturers that produce small, medium, and large versions of cars, vans, trucks, and SUV's in addition to various specialty size and propulsion designs.
*German engineering is the ""best"" and Germans are smarter than others. This is a holdover from the WWII era when Germans firmly believed they were the ""Master"" Race. Somehow it continues to be believed that what Germany does is ""superior"" to what others do. This dangerous myth nearly led the nation to the brink of annihilation. There is no REAL evidence that Germans are better at engineering. They have often been accused of OVERENGINEERING things with disastrous results. I'm afraid the German brain isn't special and isn't smarter than other brains.",none,,2023-12-02 21:29:29.647038,2.0

Even if we switch to wind energy or ocean-wave energy, I don‚Äôt believe that we will gain much. We will have to pay for it elsewhere.
For this reason, I think that the crux of the problem is not emissions, but our behavior toward nature and toward our fellow human beings. Here is where we can produce positive and lasting results. If we could communicate with one another positively, we could stop the madness of excessive development that manufactures unnecessary and harmful products.
If we could slow down a bit, we wouldn‚Äôt need to burn so much fuel in order to defeat competitors in a race for wealth that makes no one happy.

In the end, the only ones who will gain from the ‚Äúclean revolution‚Äù are the tycoons who are selling it to us, and the government officials who placate them for their own reasons.
Where is Greta Thunberg these days? Like the rest of the pawns in the battle for wealth and power, the ‚Äúclimate knights‚Äù have sent her back to oblivion once they finished using her. It is all power games among giant corporations, but the environment and the climate are no one‚Äôs concern.
Even if we switch to wind energy or ocean-wave energy, I don‚Äôt believe that we will gain much. We will have to pay for it elsewhere.
For this reason, I think that the crux of the problem is not emissions, but our behavior toward nature and toward our fellow human beings. Here is where we can produce positive and lasting results. If we could communicate with one another positively, we could stop the madness of excessive development that manufactures unnecessary and harmful products.
If we could slow down a bit, we wouldn‚Äôt need to burn so much fuel in order to defeat competitors in a race for wealth that makes no one happy. Only if we realize that our happiness depends on the quality of our relationships, and not on the padding of our bank accounts, we will be able to pause a little, think, and rebuild our civilization in a way that contributes to nature, to humanity, and to each of us.",none,,2023-12-02 21:29:29.647133,0.0

There will be many local brands of electric motorbikes and electric cars in each country due it is easier than producing a motorcycle / car with a fuel combustion engine which will be left behind.

For example how the consumer revolution related to electric cars in Southeast Asia. All Japanese brands (Toyota, Mitsubishi, Honda, Daihatsu, Datsun, etc )  have their car factory in Indonesia and produce Hybrid, PHEV and fuel combustion engine cars for local Indonesian and export market . Hyundai this year will be completed their factory in Indonesia and expected in the end of this year will be produce BEV for local Indonesian and export market which is increasingly popular in Southeast Asia and the various kinds of incentives provided by each country to accelerate the electric car industry.

Famous brand electric car manufacturers like Tesla, Hyundai, BYD to be able to compete will find a way to lower their production costs by building battery production facilities in the same area where they manufacture cars. This will be to cut the expensive supply chain costs and double taxes they have to pay and ensure the battery supply chain can continue and last a long time.

And expected the giant Tesla had to make a quick decision due Indonesia is the largest and best nickel producer in the world. And make Indonesia a biggest producer of electric battery industry from upstream to downstream.
That‚Äôs why the two battery giants LG Chem and CATL started building a battery factory in Indonesia and I think this year Panasonic will finalize with Indonesia battery holding to do the same things.

Make it possible all electric cars in the world will also use battery products from Indonesia, because these three companies control more than 70% of batteries worldwide. It would be good that Tesla also has its own battery factory in Indonesia.

Way worse than producing a petrol car. Governments only blame the consumer for driving a petrol car because they can tax them higher. They couldnt care less about the environment. Instead of forcing people into this electric car agenda, start addressing the actual main issues affecting the environment, such as heavy industry, farms (cattle, fish, pigs, chickens) they are the number one most harmful to the environment. But that will never happen because lets face it, its easier to blame the poor fellow driving his 1.2 liter turbo diesel volkswagen. He is not a multi billion dollar industry so lets tax that guy. Also lets not forget that most of the electricity in the world right now is supplied by fossil fuels. Having an electric car doesnt help the environment. It makes it worse for both the consumer and the environment.

Normal People are not any more environmentally friendly than any other citizens in the world üåé. This unprecedented shift in the buying of electric vehicles is all about they Money üí∞. New car sales in Norway are notoriously expensive because of to far to high sales tax and registration tax on cars. Combustion engine driven cars can cost customers 3-5 times as much as in the rest of Europe, because of the taxes.

People wanted change lower taxes on new car purchases to give us the same opportunity to buy higher end cars for the same amount of money the rest of Europes consumers benefit from. 

That wasn‚Äôt popular among politicians across the political landscape, but they understood riots could be the result of not giving in on some of the points. 

Some party‚Äôs in Norway are very for new green technology and therefore they pushed for electric vehicles tax exemptions and toll road exemptions that was a huge hit. People could buy bigger and better cars than they would ever be able to under the high tax on new vehicles.

That is what fuels the electric car adoption in Norway the want and need to save as much Money as possible from going into government hands. To have more in your own wallet.

It has nothing or little to do with being environmentally friendly among normal Norwegian‚Äôs. If the tax exemptions are removed and the price on electric cars sky rockets I believe many Norwegians will think twice about buying an electric and are more likely to adapt to a hybrid car. That has the best of both worlds, long range when out in the country side and electric in the city. Electric vehicles have to little range and the quality isn‚Äôt on par with german engineering and vehicles right know. So again the reason its happening is because we know in 5-7 years when that electric car we buy now has obsolete technology, we can dump the car at a car destroying company and get 250 Euros and know that it wasn‚Äôt that bad of a purchase, because it was much cheaper than anything else.",none,,2023-12-02 21:29:30.089386,0.0

Germany makes overpriced crappy cars that people will buy no matter how bad it is made and how much of a money pit it is designed to be. They have huge profit margins so even with the downsizing they will be totally fine thanks to the huge markup of their cars. Some countries may know the truth about shoddy and planned obsolescence of german cars designed to be money pits for maximum profit while some countries will stubbornly think german cars are the best even when customer support is poor and pay through the roof to own them rather than invest the money to better the business and not treat their employees and those under them like crap.

Many german brands also outsource. German cars sold in asia are made in china. They have a documentary of their china engine factory on youtube!

I've ridden in different vehicles. I find ford to be the most comfortable workman's vehicle. I've not tried korean and i find that they compete with german in quality at half the price and actually listen to the customer and give a good service but people will still be stubborn and waste their money on overpriced german moneypits.

I hate the state of modern vehicles anyway. Huge bright screens, tons of sensors that are supposed to improve safety (a noble cause), but ultimately end up failing and costing thousands to replace.


My issue with electric vehicles is the fact that they're not affordable, if the batteries go bad you're out of THOUSANDS of dollars, and the reliability of them is still in question. China's electric vehicles have had many issues with the battery banks even catching on fire. Not to mention the lithium used in the cells takes a ton of effort to mine, and pollutes worse than just driving a regular gasoline or diesel engine. Not to mention, I travel a lot for my job, and I can't be sitting around for 1 - 2 hours waiting for a vehicle to charge when the batteries run low.",none,,2023-12-02 21:29:30.357580,0.0

I've never seen propaganda from any company that says gasoline is better than electricity; That's a silly notion which can only be held by people who don't want to honestly scrutinize their beliefs for weaknesses.  German automakers do make electric cars, arguably some of the best in the world, as well as many engines with fuel efficiency and performance that people couldn't even imagine was possible a few decades ago, which has certainly helped out the environment compared to the mission to destroy the environment that they're being accused of.
Consumers generally don't buy electric cars because electric cars lose in a direct comparison with alternatives.  In my case, if I bought an affordable electric car, it would cost more than a GTI for none of the performance, I have no way of charging it in its outdoor parking space, it would always be wasting energy keeping the battery pack warm to hold a charge when it's cold outside, and I'd be limited in where I could travel compared to a gasoline car.  I'm not even sure it would be better for the environment, considering the energy required to make a car can be more than the energy the car uses in its full lifetime of driving.  
The cost/performance of batteries is really what's holding electric cars back.  There aren't unseen forces conspiring against the advancement of this technology, it just takes time to improve like every other technology.  Arguably, a truly good electricity storage technology for automotive has yet to be invented even, so throwing money at improving lithium isn't a very effective plan for automakers.  
When the electric car has the same performance and is cheaper than combustion (which is also steadily improving), then people and companies will find ways to overcome any other obstacles to making electric cars the default choice.  Nobody will oppose it.  Car companies actually like making products that consumers want to buy",none,,2023-12-02 21:29:30.576479,0.0

I had a bad experience with Volvo....

Also, Germany is trying to be more eco friendly all around. They are getting rid of nuclear plants. Replacing with solar panels and turbines. France almost completely relies on nuclear energy and produces less carbon emissions than Germany. You have to destroy entire areas to build turbines and panels farms in any subsequent numbers. And panels dont last for ever. Eventually they wear out and then all those electric chemicals in them go into junk yards. Nuclear energy is much better. Just my opinion.

Yet everything I've heard on climate change has to do with everything getting warmer. Lots of mixed messages on the CO2. CO2 obviously  naturally exists in the atmosphere do to plants breathing it out after they breathe in oxygen (in layman's terms). Before any fertilizer shortages, plants and crops on Earth are growing the largest and healthiest they have ever been. SCIENTISTS say it's from CO2 enrichmentment. That's when all plants on Earth benefit from the higher amounts of CO2(that includes the rainforests).  And in return, they pump out more Oxygen. Haven't heard this theory before? That's the relationship between plants and animals and it has been 4 probably a couple million years. More CO2, more oxygen. People that grow indoors have been using CO2 enrichment for decades. So you've now heard the pro, and the con was everything is going to get hotter? Everything is going to get colder? It's a fact that the United States of America had more extreme weather between 1910 and 1930. Look it up. Also this is going to sound crazy, but the Earth every year either moved closer to the Sun or it moves closer to the Earth. Right now the Earth is heading back towards the sun. And it will continue to move back towards the Sun for quite a long time. Where we're coming from was as far away from the Sun as possible. That was when we were in the middle of the ice age. Now we're moving far away from that. We are right now according to scientists still in the intermediate iceage. That's right it's still the ice age. And every year we move further away from it. The weather and the temperature is gradually change. Eventually have the glaciers on Earth will not exist. The other half will be in prime locations very high elevation, that sort of thing. What was the last time a politician pushing for this climate-change / global warming crap informed you of this? Results of these crazy things called solar flares/sun activity that have impacted the climate in the United States let alone the world for millions of years.

with an important message as we enter the third decade of the twenty-first century
Things Are Going Uhm... fine, overall
The Amazon Is fine...
Half of Africa Is fine
So is the Artic, Indonesia, Spain, Greece...
even Greenland's on a fucking fire - i mean, fine
Scientists have coined a new term for this stage of climate change we're entering:We're Funded
| Unlike the previous stage, which climate scientists called ""Listen to us or we might be funded""
We're Funded is happening, and in your lifetime
This is thanks to us wasting decades pissfarting around at climate summits with non-binding emission targets
whilist handing our subsidies to climate criminals
obstructing renewables
and generally not giving a peak that rising CO2 levels are about to trigger what scientists call ""Feedback Loops""
Basically
A Feedback Loop is the scientific term for when a species uses its own ignorance
to screw itself and everything around its so hard that it's own planet even tell it to GTFO
Some people are already experiencing We're Funded
Such as these Pacific Nations facing rising sea levels
Who recently begged Australia to please stop burning coal
To which Australia responded, ""get funded""
The combination of We're Funded and Get Funded
will cause wars to break out over access to food and water
Except in America, where the Chosen One will just nuke hunger
Would You Like To Know More?
But please, don't panic
If the realisation that We're Funded troubles you
why not ride a bike to work?
have shorter showers
or send thoughts and prayers?
Just don't join the global climate strike this September
Or Extinction Rebillion in October
Because a sustained, collective movement would force us to take drastic action and turn this ship around
which might be just doable if enough of you demand it
Or you could go to Area 51 and demand to see the aliens
In this case, we're definetly funded
This has been a message from your local Government franchise

Maybe the government should target the government incentives and regulations for conventional engined tuktuk and motorcycles to be replaced with electric motor since those who drive them are unlikely able to afford a cheap EV even with subsidies, and use tuktuk or moped taxi as a main income source, not a comfortable/eco-friendly transportation or wealth status... just a thought!",none,,2023-12-02 21:30:34.144883,0.0

Lyrics: 
Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take?

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying, baby, baby please

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take?

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take)
(Every move you make)

I'll be watching you

Lyrics: 
Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take?

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying, baby, baby please

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take?

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take)
(Every move you make)
(Every bond you break)
(Every step you take) I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you

They claim every vehicle is fully inspected and any necessary repairs are done. Former employees indicate that is true.  They openly acknowledge they charge more for their vehicles than the typical used car dealer and undervalue potential trade vehicles. Are their additional cost worth the potential benefits they offer? Customers have to decide that for themselves.

I do not want another CVT and why are they putting them into all the other brands that were good?  We will see how this Mazda will do but I will keep it, hopefully no matter the problems it comes to. Honestly  it's a risk no matter what you run into. Scotty was very right on the Nissian CVT and it doesn't just effect the older ones but even the new ones. I've seen alot of nissians parked on the side of the freeways here in Houston during hot days. I do suspect that the hot and cold and back and forth inside wiring and sensors build a resistance over time causing malfunctions in all the newer cars. Youtube is a growing number of people with CVT complaints and problems with all the other car brands.  Can the U.S hold down the demand of power if they have everyone driving an electric car?

They have bigger things to worry about than providing details en mass like that.  Regarding their pricing, it depends on the car.  But his assertion they are worse than other dealers is laughable.

My suspicion is this guy either owns a car sales business on the side, or has many friends who do and used his platform to bash a competitor.  Should you buy every car from CarMax?

Couldn't find the exact car I wanted locally, and didn't want to compromise.  They charged me a couple hundreds dollars to ship it half way across the country, which seemed fair.  There was a slight upcharge on the car compared to other local spots (~5% in my case), but it was still within the fair KBB market value.  And they gave me a little more on my trade in than anyone else for whatever reason, so that helped wipe out most of the difference.  

Then you get that 24 hour test drive and 30 day money back guarantee, which gives you plenty of time to get it checked out by a mechanic and run the piss out of it to make sure it's a solid car with no duck tape holding it together.

Frankly I think they're a pretty solid setup and wouldn't have any problem recommending them, I'd just tell people to do their due diligence.  You pay a slight upcharge, but the convenience,  massive selection, no nonsense process,  and piece of mind made it a pretty fair deal IMO.",none,,2023-12-02 21:30:49.048991,2.0

Go to their website and every vehicle listed has the history available. They use Experian's AutoCheck. NOTHING is hidden. 2) Yes, Carfax and AutoCheck may not be 100% accurate but they are the same sources used by every other dealer or seller of used vehicles, as well as buyers. 3) Carmax has a 7 day return policy. You can test drive a vehicle for a whole week, have it checked out by one or more mechanics and if you are not satisfied and the vehicle is not damaged Carmax will take the vehicle back within the seven day period, no questions asked. 4) I have purchased rental cars and have had no issues. Rental cars are maintained regularly and kept in good condition and usually have low miles 5) It is Carmax's policy to not sell cars with frame damage. If a car should slip through their quality audit for frame damage they have taken the car back. 6) Regular dealers are notorious for their used car warranty - 30 seconds or 30 miles, whichever comes first. Carmax vehicles have a 90 day, 4K mile limited warranty. And I do not believe private sellers offer any warranty. 
Pricing is a function of the value provided. Carmax may have premium pricing but they offer haggle free transactions, vast selection and peace of mind. I declined an offer for my Mazda from Carmax for a price that I thought was $1K too low. It took me six months, many test drives and a whole lot of running around to finally sell the car for about $250 more than I could have sold it to Carmax. So it depends on how much an individual values their time and effort. 
You may speculate that I am an employee or have some connection to Carmax, but I do not. Carmax is not perfect and I do not appreciate the hard sell on their extended service plans. In this respect they are no different  than all sellers of extended service plans for automobiles or anything else.

Before I owned my own shop In the 1980's I was making $80-100,000 a year when shop labor rates to the customer were about $25 hour in the 1990's it drop to $40-60000 with labor rate about $40 hour and in the 2000s $35-50000 labor rate $80-110 an hour with no benefits so labor rates were going up but the pay was going down. My friends at CarMax are happy because they get paid fairly with benefits and what you pay for a car is up to you so don't blame the company if you pay to much most of the time people who buy cars at any dealer don't have the cash to buy from a private party and they need financing so you will always pay more and as far as problems with used cars remember used is used not new. Working from home in your garage is like no overhead costs at all compared to a real automotive retail business like I owned my monthly overhead before paying myself average $25-35000 a month with just two employees but I took good care of my people. When self-employed you must provide all your own benefits. If something goes wrong with your car that the back yard mechanic fixes for you and saved you all that money who do you sue when he has nothing to take and most likely no insurance. You saved money but now that brake job just costs someone's life and you are on your own baby. It takes money to make money Scotty and give your employees a fair paycheck that a family can live on nowadays. What kind of pay and benefits do you demand to support a family? nowadays if you have two kids and want to own a home and provide all that is needed for a family I would say $60,000 a year is the minimum needed and if no benefits you will need more. It's easy to be on the outside looking in at someone's business but not so easy when you must be the guy who pays the bills just look at what big companies are losing now when something goes wrong and this is only the beginning.",none,,2023-12-02 21:30:49.247969,0.0

What he does like, you will never find it when you need it. Plus, I would rather pay about 10% more, and not have to deal with a used car salesman or a dealership. You are quite likely to get ripped off at one of those worse than a Carmax. It‚Äôs almost pure luck to find a private seller that has what you want when you need it.

We bought a '14 MDX just off lease so 43K miles in 2016. SUV was $30,500. Spotless inside and out. Acura CPO cars were $4K-$5K more and they would not haggle over the phone or by email. The nearest dealers were 2+ hrs away. NADA price was about $31K. We spent ~1 hr the first evening looking at the car in person and driving it. We returned the following evening to finish the paperwork and handed a cashier's check to the CarMax salesman. No haggle. No problems. No pressure. Car had a warranty. Could have returned the car if we didn't like it. CarMax even put it on a lift so I could poke around underneath with a flashlight. Several tens of thousands of miles later the car remains trouble free and meets our expectations. We've had great success with Honda products since the 1980s. 


Alternatively I could have spent significant amounts of time chasing a similar SUV on various websites and Craigslist plus time driving to see the SUV in person. It could have been like my previous new car experience where I visited a number of new car dealerships and experienced just about every scheme invented before finally getting a ""fair deal"". Salesmen lied to us, wasted our time, had microphones/webcams in their offices, ran our credit without our permission, told me I didn't know what I was talking about (we wanted a 5MT which the first salesman claimed wasn't available and it was). Lied and told us the cabin filter filtered skunk smells out of the cabin air. One male salesman broke down in tears instead of haggling b/c my initial offer was too low. 


So yeah, the typical car dealer experience sucks. CarMax has improved on this greatly as has (perhaps) Carvana and Tesla. I'd prefer the European option of simply buying my car from the factory and picking it up at the factory and never dealing with American car dealers at all. I'm sure the average car dealer experience is a fine one if I walked in an paid the sticker price.",none,,2023-12-02 21:30:49.640119,0.0

2) Arrange your financing before car shopping. Credit Unions sometimes give the best rates. If your credit is bad, save up cash and buy a older used car from an individual, but have it checked out by a trusted mechanic first. 
3) If buying from a regular car dealer, go at the end of the month. Salesmen and the dealer get bonuses for sales, so they lower their prices to move 'em out as an incentive. 
4) Scotty is right about this, Don't buy a new car unless you plan on keeping it for 5 years or longer. Depreciation will kill the car's value the first 3-4 years.

1. If a disaster strikes or a war happens, a nuclear power plant becomes a time bomb. Wherever disaster struck, people have not gone back to live there. Check Chernobyl, Fukushima online.
When accidents happen in other places, people in the factory die, its a one time incident, normal life resumes but here whole towns and villages are vacated permanently and effects will be felt for generations.

2. The water that's used to cool the reactors is pumped back to the sea. It's super hot when it goes back. This spoils marine life and the fishermen who depend on it near it's vicinity.

3. AFR literally means Away From Reactor. Govt wants to build this disposal plant in koodankulam it self. Why didn't you speak of it, when mentioning the issue in koodankulam.

4. Hydro isn't clean. If we generate power from running water using the same dynamo set up, as in gravity light, it's clean. If it's using large dams it's not. It can create landslides when near hills, which it is always. It upsets the balance in nature's design. Also it stops minerals and nutrients from the hills reaching the fields. These deposits over years can increase the acidity of water. Even if it's rare, it's a possibility.

4. If we connect rivers like in the past via ground it's acceptable. Because it recharges water table along the way. But these projects offer to build concrete channels. It only benefits the big corporations that build it.

Points 4 & 5 affects marine life. Not that we'll care.

6. Most of our clean power is coming from windmills. You can see the effects of it in Radhapuram district. Before windmills arrived, it was a lush forest with following streams. Now it's a desert. Some people travel 16 km for water. Check google earth and you'll see the desert that it has become. So depending on application it becomes clean or unclean. This is why smarter countries keep it in the ocean.

7. The most abundant natural power available to us is sun. It's a cleaner form. All house roofs in urban areas can have it. Excess power can be given back to grid. Why not speak more on that.

8. Agreed power need is more. But clean solution lies in decentralising power, not centralising power through dams and nuclear plants.

I don't think you're unaware of all of this. Maybe you didn't cover these topics because you didn't have enough time in the show. Still, i would like to know your thoughts.",none,,2023-12-02 21:30:54.745238,0.0

You are well talented to change the direction of all the People's protest against the projects which are causing damage to our society

I'm following you for the past few years

Previously you posted a video to divert the  Sterlite protest that you are showing Sterlite is less harmful than VV Minerals

Now this Video, super dude. Great Job.üòÇ

There are lots of means to get renewable energy thru, solar, wind, tidal, hydel and the gravity. But in my views, wind energy is not suitable for a large scale production as it has many severe consequences. As the turbines are driven by wind, the velocity of wind decreases, thereby might reduce the rainfall on the interior regions which can be catastrophic. Rather we could rely on tidal energy and also from hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen can be used for both power production and vehicles, and lot more utilities. Kindly check through these links

Please correct this "" India la produce panra electricity la 34% renewable "". Please understand the difference between installed capacity and production. After the emergence of solar and wind energy the usage of installed capacity to represent production would be misleading as PLFs of solar n wind would be in the range of 15 to 25%. In my opinion,  the share of renewables in total production would not be more than 10%. I will leave it to you to research and give actual percentage.

I‚Äôve just had a good lengthy drive of the Kona, (well two drives today actually) and have to confess that I‚Äôm shocked!

I drove the Kona when I dropped off our PHEV this morning for a service - quite literally the first from the public to drive it at our local dealer. Even the dealer hasn‚Äôt driven it since the Sydney reveal a few months ago.
Initial impressions, very good, and (quite honestly) very bad in some areas.

Power? Great, but VERY inclined to chirp or spin the front wheels, and LOTS and LOTS of torque steer when you plant it hard. It will absolutely chew through front tyres if driven hard. I can‚Äôt begin to imagine how it would be a wet road. The power ‚Äúcurve‚Äù through the accelerator sensitivity at some speeds seemed off, a tad hard to control and not at all smooth. (Our PHEV is much smoother, though of course much less power on tap, and my recollection from my three Tesla drives, including an S for a whole weekend, was also much smoother.) 
I love the variable flappy paddle regen, and do dearly wish the Tesla‚Äôs had that. After getting used to it on the PHEV, I will definitely miss it.

Driving seat and dash- mostly good, though ‚Äúfussy‚Äù and quite involved, even somewhat unintuitive getting through the multiple menu‚Äôs. I love Tesla‚Äôs KISS principle, like an iPhone compared to using Windows. Strangely the test car is a basic model called ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù edition, and had a different, significantly smaller screen on the centre of the dash to either the Elite or Highlander, so not truly representative of what‚Äôs now on sale.
Great ride, compared to the petrol Kona which is quite harsh and choppy by comparison.

The battery hangs very low, and I‚Äôd be VERY scared about damaging it on dirt roads or with debris on the highway. Basically if I saw anything on the road, I‚Äôd want to avoid it at all costs.
Rear seat leg room- absolutely bloody terrible, might be Ok with a short driver. (I‚Äôm 187cm.) After driving it for a while and getting the seat in the proper driving position, it was virtually physically impossible for me to get in the rear seat through a half open door (due to cars parked beside us, typical of a shopping centre car park.) Leg room was really terrible, almost non existent! When I eventually squeezed in, my head was touching the roof liner.
Thus the rear seat adjusted for a taller driver might be ok for maybe a five year old, (even though they‚Äôd whinge), and not much older!


The ‚Äúlane keep assist‚Äù autopilot feature on the test car was worse than useless, refused to work with shadows on the road then just barely worked ‚Äúping pong‚Äù style when there were no shadows. It was nowhere near as good as the RAV4 hire car we had in England last year.
Basically a massive disappointment, a massive fail.
However after a bit of further research, I‚Äôm genuinely shocked. It turns out that here in Oz  üá¶üá∫ , we get only ‚Äúlane keep assist‚Äù, which is almost useless. In the UK and Europe, all the video reviews you‚Äôll see have both ‚Äúlane keep assist‚Äù AND ‚Äúlane follow assist‚Äù. On the UK website, that‚Äôs on both their mid and top spec models. The difference is night and day, with the latter (ie: Euro spec) being a basic autopilot, the former meaning you‚Äôll just ping-pong down the road, maybe if you‚Äôre lucky. I found it often did nothing at all.

Adaptive cruise control is pretty much like any other car with that feature, and can actually be used with the ‚Äúadaptive‚Äù function turned off,  perhaps could be useful occasionally, unlike many other cars which are ‚Äúall or none‚Äù. It has the usual problems like slowing dramatically for a car turning left in front of you, or cutting into your lane.

How much? Too much, a few hundred dollars change out of $70k for the Highlander. - The Elite doesn‚Äôt even have LED headlights!

I‚Äôm shocked about the lack of ‚Äúlane keep follow‚Äù, a total 100% deal breaker even ignoring 


After that drive this morning, and then another this afternoon with my wife, I‚Äôm honestly more convinced than ever about a Model 3.",none,,2023-12-02 21:30:55.485035,2.0

Following is my Youtube post of my Multi-speed transmission I have called: ""Opposing Torque Dynamic Clutch"" which is a type of Infinitely Variable Transmission (IVT) which I believe is ideal for your current applications. Australian Patent Number: 2020201132. Please log on to my Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SACDK89U7PM In summary: It is a Compound Planetary System with two inputs from two separate electric motors. Motor 1 tries to rotate the carrier counter-clockwise and Motor 2 tries to rotate the carrier clockwise. The ratio, acceleration and speed of the vehicle is controlled by the amount and proportion of power/torque from the two motors. In addition the ratio of the transmission is affected by the speed and load of the vehicle. So, with the aid of speed sensors on all the components of the transmission, the speed of the vehicle, position of the accelerator and a kick-down switch - all that is needed to control the whole system is a computer. There is no actual gear selector for the driver to operate, however a manual mode would be appropriate where the driver has a 'balance' control knob that manually controls the proportion of power/torque to each motor and therefore can choose any ratio desired for the driving situation. An added enhancement could be added to the transmission by having a traditional planetary overdrive attached to each of the motors to enhance the rev range of each motor. This would enable the provision of extra modes like economy mode/sports mode and improve the kick-down mode by inputting more revs when the gearbox is in an extremely low ratio during kick-down operation. Having this type of transmission would improve acceleration and range of the vehicle allowing for a smaller battery pack/lighter weight leading to cost savings and simpler manufacturing.

Seems to be completely a load of balderdash to me as the car itself was most definitely designed in China and will probably be at least 90% made in China as well!!! So the 100% Aussie is completely false advertising, at the cost of genuine Aussie startups and companies!!! 

And maybe while you're at it you could investigate ""Sea Electric"" which is another ""Aussie"" company that likes to push the whole ""Aussie"" band wagon, while largely simply importing pre-existing Chinese electric vehicles! And don't get me wrong, I'm all for electric vehicles and even Chinese one's, what peeves me is when companies pickup cookie cutter ready made solutions, and then promote it as if it's their own. Sea Electric maybe has a bit of it's own intellectual property, what it is, or how it's superior to anyone else's no one really knows!  


I mean Tesla opensource their patents, and have been pretty open from the get go about what they are doing and how they're achieving what they are. Their designs are ACTUALLY different to the industry standard, where as Sea Electric, visibly, doesn't appear to be doing anything overly different and the fact that most of their vans are imports from China (or maybe Thailand?!?) would suggest that they potentially have very little of their own intellectual property, a fact that investors/partners should be aware of before signing up to any form of ""licensing"" agreement! 


It would be great if you or some other journo would dare to dig in and have a closer examination of what seems to be a bit of an alarming trend with these little ""fake front"" companies popping up all over trying to promote themselves as ""Aussie"", while having little else but an Aussie owner/shareholder! In time, this sort of thing only results in a lot of people getting hurt, from mum and dad type investors, through to people buying these products. Aside from that it damages the ""Aussie"" reputation, and makes it so much harder for genuinely innovative Aussie companies to thrive!",none,,2023-12-02 21:30:56.297738,0.0

I can see they're trying to service the small delivery company area but ~200km on a single charge. That'll get eaten up fast by courier drivers.

I note that we didn't hear how long a quick-charge would take to top-up to give you another X kms. It seemed to cut to ""full overnight charge"".
EDIT: I used to do delivery driving for a food restaurant many moons ago. Would easily manage 20-30 deliveries a night and a quick google maps check of the usual delivery areas puts that in the 5-8km range of travel per delivery.

Sure every-time I'm back I can just plug it in to keep it topped up but that implies an charge point accessible at the place of business.
That equates to 120km driven at night time, not including any daytime travel I might do in my regular daily duties.

They are not permitted on main roads with the exception of when crossing at a pedestrian crossings then you immediately have to ride it on the sidewalk. Personally I wouldn't dare ride it on the road because of crazy drivers in the city. Actually you gotta be out of your mind to ride it on the road with the  unknown potholes etc. If you stick to the side walks you are relatively safe. In Australia the sidewalks are mostly pretty wide enough for both foot traffic and scooters. I personally don't ride it fast when there are big crowds of people on the foot path. I slow down and when the opportunity arises where the footpath is wide enough I would pass them. When on the side walks in the metro city areas you have to be stupid to go fast because you don't know when a truck or lorry pops out from carpark entrances and exits. I can imagine there are risks involved. I familiarise my route and I know all possible cracks in the road or where the carpark entrances are where cars can magically appear in front of you when riding on the footpath. Maybe they should allow people to have their own scooter and get rid of the commercial ride share companies. If people had their own personal escooter they would not leave it out on the street to get stolen because they are expensive as hell. People can place them under their desks at work or at stow it away at their destination.,none,,2023-12-02 21:31:07.232324,0.0

The rule there is that if you are on the pavement you can't go faster than pedestrians, if you are in the cycle lane you have to go at the speed of a bicycle. Very simple. E-scooters would cut congestion & improve air quality in every town in the UK - they are clean and they are silent. I bought one as soon as I returned to the UK and use it occasionally to get into the local town - our town is permanently gridlocked and there is not enough car parking. E-scooters are a logical step in cutting emissions and removing traffic jams. I think they are much safer than bicycles, if ridden sensibly, because you are close to the ground, you can react quickly to the environment around you. If people are worried about an excess of rental scooters littering the streets, then at least allow privately owned scooters. I think having an age limit of 17+ would be useful, and the same rules of the road as Stockholm in terms of where you ride them.

Here in Helsinki they were a bit chaotic at first, but etiquette has quickly developed around where they should be ridden, bike lanes and slow roads. Where to park, around metro stations, shopping malls and grocery stores, and when possible next to bike racks. Laws limit the rentable ones to a fastish jogging pace which while difficult to maintain on foot without getting winded still allows one to very safely bail on the scooter when hitting a pothole.

Only privately owned PEVs can go faster and helmets are highly encouraged all around. The rentable scooters seem to have fit in next to the pre-existing city sponsored shared bikes and a lot of the etiquette has crossed over. People actually carry helmets when intending to commute using one of these.

There are also clear laws around electrically powered vehicles and they very sensibly are given a power limit below which they may be used like bikes and above which they are only to be used on roads.

They usually charge almost 40-50% less than getting insurance from dealers. 
Claim settlement ratio is a vague concept to measure efficiency of an insurance company. You should instead focus on amount of claim settlement by companies. Pvt cos are known for settling small claim very swiftly and are notorious for denying (on any flimsy grounds) or under-settling big claims. So they can easily maintain good claim settlement ratio despite having far lesser amount settlement ratio.
PSUs have backing of govt and claim settlement is transparent and generous irrespective of the claim amount. They simple reason is: they have to strictly follow IRDAI guidelines and PSUs have social service as priority not brute profits. And now a days they match or even exceed the TAT( turn around time) compared to PVT companies. If you check the no of complaints against insurers in website of Ombudsman, Beema lokpal or IRDAI, private companies top the disgraceful list and govt companies are least tarnished.
Now,the question arises why dealers or online portals / web aggregators don't prefer PSUs
1) Huge commission paid by Pvt cos to dealers and online web aggregators. So, they sideline PSU insurers and charge hefty premiums from unsuspecting customers so that they can enjoy mammoth share of your premium as commission, totally flouting IRDAI rules.
2) The dealers and web aggregators have to scrupulously comply with IRDAI guidelines while dealing with PSU insurers which will reduce any foul play or   unfair practices which are meant for safeguarding customers against any fraud. Remember,if your claim is stuck by dealer or Pvt cos,you are nowhere to go but in govt companies, strict compliance saves any injustice. So dealers want monopoly in their hands not yours.
Thus, you can draw the inference as to why PSU insurers should the only choice while buying insurance for your loved vehicle.
The 4 renowned PSU/ Govt insurance companies are
1) UNITED INDIA INSURANCE CO. LTD
2) NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD.
3) NATIONAL INSURANCE CO. LTD.
4) ORIENTAL INSURANCE CO. LTD.
So, next time you buy a new vehicle,never purchase insurance from dealer instead approach PSU office and get cover for your vehicle. And whenever you renew your cover, do the same .

What are EV's?
EV's are essentially a pool of 512 points that you can invest in your pokemon's stats to increase them. You can only spend up to 252 points in a single stat.

Why are EV's important?
Using EV's to increase your stats is extremely important because it can lead to killing with moves that wouldn't normally kill, surviving moves that would normally kill, and outspeeding your oponent when you normally wouldn't.

How do I get EV train my pokemon?

Method 1 - the old fashioned way
Any wild pokemon that you knock out will award your team with EV points in a certain stat based on the wild pokemon. For example, a machoke will give your party 2 attack EV's. Once you know what EV's you want, find a pokemon that gives them on Cerebi, and go knock some out until you hit the desired EV points.

Method 2 - The baller way
You can buy vitamins with money or BP, and they each give 10 EV points in a specific stat.

Method 3 - Jobs
Sending pokemon on jobs will passively give them EV's. With full bonuses, maxing EV's in a stat takes 24 hours.

Speeding up the process
To speed up EV training, you can give your pokemon power items, purchasable for 10 BP. Holding a power item will add 5 EV's of a certain stat everytime you gain EV's.
You can also infect your pokemon with pokerus, which doubles the speed at which you gain EV's, stacking with power items.

How do I know how to spread my EV's?
Good question. I have no idea.",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:31.837271,0.0

For those who don't know, EVs before capped at 255 per stat and 510 total. However, if your EVs are not perfectly divisible by 4, then those remainder EVs will go to waste. With 510, you can only spare 2 extra EVs (510 -252 -252 -4 =2) without wasting any, so if you took a stat to the previous max, 255 then 255-252=3. 3 EVs would go to waste, and you'd miss a single stat point. While this may seem negligible, a single stat can make a world of a difference. It could garuntee or better your roll odds to OHKO or survive an attack that could OHKO, it could take you from being slower to a speed tie or a speed tie to outspeeding.

Everyone's celebrating that you can use G-max meowth to grind for money, but then what about people who get the game a few months from now when the event is over and you can't get the meowth anymore? For anyone who didn't buy the games early, the system is painfully slow. 



And even with the meowth, you only get, what? Roughly 340,000 dollars per cycle? That's not even enough money to ev train a single pokemon. When you compare it to a game like XY where you could just do 10 horde battles and already have maxed out pokemon, swsh seems like a massive step backwards. 



And it's not like you won't have to fight wild pokemon as well. Since the vitamins only give multiples of 10, any custom ev spread that isn't just 252/252/4 is still going to require wild battles to get the exact numbers.


Top that all off with no more berry farming, and the drastic reduction to bp earned from the battle tower, where getting a single nature mint, ability capsule, and 1-2 bottle caps is still slower than just breeding.


I can't even describe how disappointed I am with all the arbitrary changes to the system that honestly makes it feel like getting competitive pokemon is going to take longer than it did in gen 7.",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:32.461879,1.0

What end up happening is that the battery cable and it's clamp are  just tightened around the top and flush with the the battery post.  Since there is a slight slope on the battery post the battery post clamp cannot fully tightened around this battery terminal area.  To fix this simple mistake just take a small dowel and a hammer and tap the battery post clamp till it is flush with bottom of the battery post.  Then tighten the battery nut and bolt clamp at this wider battery post point.  this will give the battery post a much better fit and enable the battery's current to pass through the posts and terminals as easily as possible.....,none,,2023-12-02 21:32:00.974064,0.0

Never did find anything wrong with it and talked to the owner. He kept his auto lights adjusted all the way to the max so he could get into his house at night and only had the problem when he left his car at the airport when going on 1-2 week trips. I suggested he turn off his timer because the draw would weaken his battery and after sitting that long without starting it wouldn't recover from the draw. I never saw him again until the shop did service calls a few months later to see why he didn't return and told him forget my advise. The following week the car was back with the same problem and 3 other people looked at it and found nothing wrong. Shortly after that I went round & round with the service manager because he kept setting timing on a car using the mag riming notch and I told him that mark was only if you had a scope with the proper probe that there was another mark he had to use with a light and he told me I was stupid because he was a super master tech and knew everything, so I quit and went to work somewhere else where people actually knew what they were doing. Some people think just because they pass a test they know which end of a wrench to hold. At another shop I worked at They hired a new master tech and paid him way more than the rest of us who worked there for years and were also masters. He was just out of school and passed the test. His first car was a jeep no-start, he worked on it for a week replacing sensors and computer but all it would do was crank. We refused to help him because they wouldn't give us a raise or cut his pay down to our level. We knew what the problem was from day 1 but kept laughing at the know it all pro. After a week the manager asked us what we though and we all said why don't the pulleys turn when cranking? So he ended up putting a flywheel in it and it left. Shortly after he quit and we were all satisfied.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:00.975153,0.0

NOT a mechanic but lived with one and worked selling auto parts.  My 3400 v6 2005 impala. Almost new Napa 75 legend battery. Battery would every so often be dead. Had to call mechanic to come charge tested battery showed good. Told hi. I wanted a new one. Just to be safe. After couple of months. Same thing when I took it to another shop where I was dead in the water again They assumed me it was the throttle body injector or ?  Whatever ints called. How would that make a battery drain? When I questioned he said go ahead wait  a week its still what I told you. It's Russian roulette you are playing? Mechanic said it wouldn't hurt to go couple of weeks but the counter guy told me do it now!. They also did a 373.dollar job when my engine kept overheating. Thought it was thermostat. They replaced 2 months ago now its pegging max hot in the red zone. I've spent over 700 dollars and my car  is sitting in my drive way and I've missed 4 days work. I live in a remote area. I'm stuck here and angry about all of this.,none,,2023-12-02 21:32:01.541866,0.0

We had an army 5 ton that had a generator overcharge the 4 huge 12 volt batteries that were in paired series/parallel, two banks of 12 volt parallel in series for a high amp 24 volt system.  We were on a 10 hour drive across Germany and didn't realize we were being gassed from the cooking batteries off gassing into the cab until we both started getting raw throats, coughing uncontrollably, screaming headaches and finally pulling over to puke our guts out.  When we felt like going back to the cab to check things out we noticed a steady stream of white cloud coming from the back of the cab body outside, it was the vent from the bench style battery compartment under the passenger/middle seat.  The motorpool mechanic said that the batteries were so hot, that they were still nearly boiling the next morning after the truck being towed to the nearest post and battery caps removed in the shop to check them.  They wound up waiting another 2 days letting them cool before removing them while they got the new replacement batteries and new generator replacement.  The older 5 ton trucks had generators instead of alternators that had to be ""tuned"" to the right output voltage with a hex key adjusting a trim potentiometer built into the generator.  The generator on our truck had this trim potentiometer go bad and no matter how it was adjusted it put out almost twice the voltage on a 24 volt system, hence the overcooked batteries.  The ""vent on the back of the cab wall was an attempt to keep battery off gassing out of the cab and outside instead, it didn't work.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:01.544343,3.0

Also check the the belt's tentioning to move the alternator. I had to have my alternator replaced and decided to have the belts changed as well. The battery now works more efficiantly. Also my battery is not the standard 12volt because I have many features than can disrupt a lower 12 voltage battery. Mine uses a 13volt battery. Running a car radio with the engine off drains the batteryTurning on head lights before warming up your car and recharging the battery from your alternator can drain your battery over time. I usually wait ten to 15 mins before I turn on my accessories and head lights and repeat the process in reverse to turn off accessories to let the car idle for 10 minutes before turning off the engine and in this way when I repeat these steps the battery gets the full 20 minutes of recovery time between 10 minute sessions.,none,,2023-12-02 21:32:01.763703,0.0

I love your interview style and you know exactly where to pitch the line to get your interviewees to answer the difficult questions whilst avoiding being too confrontational. 

10% per tonne being tantalite at $150,000 p.t. means the tin production is effectively free and I think Anthony was about to say that before you cut him off at 27:09 ""lowers my cost of tin to the point that...."". Add Lithium sales on that and the behemoth resource (Anthony's words) and this is appears to be a monster company in the making. At the current market cap with a target of $100m revenue in 5 years with an effective tin cost of zero after tantalum credits and a CEO committed to only value accretive dilution this sounds like a very attractive proposition indeed - if 50% of that is returned to shareholders each year we could be looking at a dividend double the current share price.

To hell with these companies and government policies. 
I think private sector should come into play and start producing local cars at a reasonable price.
We are fed up with government.
When will we see cars like Tesla, Ford, Bentley, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, GMC in Pakistan at the exact same rate as they are in foreign countries?
Why the hell does government puts 300% import duty on cars? 
I think its our government who loots people the most.
These ministers always travel in big machines like Land cruiser, Lexus which is worth 4 crore. Where does this money comes from? (Most probably from our taxes)
