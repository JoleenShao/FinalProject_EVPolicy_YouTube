These things are rotting on the lot and it isn't just due to Bidenomics and Inflation but also because people do not want them because the consumer is smart enough to know these will not work for them in their daily lives. Also American's don't like being told what they can and cannot drive, own or buy by the government.
They can keep these overpriced glorified golf carts rotting on the dealership lots, let the dealerships go thru the trouble of seeing how quickly even with nobody using them they experience battery drain and let them keep them long enough they'll need full battery pack replacement which is around $20,000 and cannot be performed by most mechanics or dealership service centers. Meanwhile when I put gas in my 2001 Chevy S10 ZR2 it doesn't vanish if I don't drive it for a few days, it stays exactly at the level I parked it at.

By weaponizing the ""Green Deal"" and urging individuals to transition away from gasoline-powered vehicles, President Biden is taking important steps towards combatting climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, concerns have been raised regarding the financial support provided to China, the world's biggest polluter.
The fact that Biden is providing financial support to China through the ""Green Deal"" while China prepares for war raises questions about the effectiveness and ethical implications of such policies. Supporting a country that contributes significantly to global pollution and has a dubious track record on human rights sends a conflicting message about the priorities and policies of the United States.
However, as China silently prepares for war, it is important for the international community to closely monitor their actions and intentions. The preparation for war, if true, raises significant concerns about regional and global stability. Transparency and open dialogue between nations become even more crucial in navigating through these complex circumstances.
While combining climate change initiatives with political maneuvering Joe Biden sold out America for cheap by using ""the green deal"" attempting to force all Western countries to stop Oil/Gas production by blending their weapon as the ""Cure"" in an attempt to finance China directly. 
As China silently prepares for war by sending spy balloons all over the US and awaiting the end of Western GAS due to Joe Biden's policies by weaponizing Russia sanctions not only against Russia but against their own allies UK/EU, Joe Biden set the record straight and destroyed the Nord Stream pipeline.
It is imperative that the Biden administration reevaluates its approach, considering the potential security implications of its environmental policy initiatives. While the focus on climate change and the transition to renewable energy should remain a priority, it is crucial to ensure that our actions do not inadvertently strengthen a potential adversary.
In conclusion, the concerns raised regarding financial support to China alongside its alleged silent war preparations are significant. China's quest for dominance in the global arena, coupled with its disregard for environmental standards, raises serious questions about the wisdom of providing financial support to a country that is already responsible for a significant portion of the world's pollution. By doing so, we may inadvertently be fueling China's ability to further its military ambitions, posing a threat to regional stability and potentially even global security.",none,,2023-12-02 21:30:59.844220,0.0

An American can now purchase a Chevrolet Bolt for less than $30,000, before the $7,500 federal tax rebate, plus more at the state level in many states.  The grid is being updated, and thousands of new charging stations are being installed, as well as Tesla opening up their chargers to non-Tesla autos.   In the meantime, petroleum is killing the planet, the direct cause of all the crazy weather, all over the globe that is now affecting our food supply.  This change can't happen fast enough, and this story is laden with half truths, and no factual information about how much owning an EV costs LESS than owning an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle.  Start running THOSE stories instead of this BS that was probably done to appease the fossil fuel business.

HERE'S SOME ANSWERS.  An apartment dweller who parks your car off the street can probably charge with a heavy extension cord plugged into the outside plug, or inside.  Or, you can go to a Fast Charge station and do most of your charging, abuot 180 miles worth no more than an hour.  Fast chargers are now located at most Walmarts and Sam's clubs, and all over most urban/suburban areas.  check the website www.plugshare.com for locations, or get the app for your mobile phone.  A Chevy Bolt will fast charge in 45 minutes to an hour, giving 180 miles of range for less than $10.  Can you drive your current auto that far, that cheap?  If you get a level two charger installed in your garage or on the side of your house, you can fully charge your car overnight while you sleep for around $3. (YES, THREE DOLLARS) worth of electricity.  Can you drive your current car over 200 miles for THREE DOLLARS?  
A Chevy Bolt is around $22,000 aafter the federal tax rebate, and some states also offer rebates.
All this fear mongering is spread by the petroleum industry that doesn't want you to stop your addiction to their product.  Also, an EV has virtually NO maintenance.  NO: oil changes, spark plugs, wires, tune ups, drive belts to break, transmission to go out.  Even the AC doesn't lose refrigerant from one summer to the next.  Maintenance on an EV?  FILLING THE WINDSHIELD WASHER !! And rotating the tires.  Even the brake pads last over 100,000 miles.",none,,2023-12-02 21:30:59.846354,0.0

So many lies put out by the fossil fuel industry that's scared right now. A new Tesla for $33k after tax incentives, costs on average $17.5 for 405 miles of range. A similar gas powered car cost $40.60 for 400 miles. An EV will use $4321 for 100,000 miles, the gas car will cost $10,150 for 100,000 miles. That's almost $6000 in fuel savings. Then EVs have far less maintenance, and tesla rates their batteries and motors for between 200,000 to 500,000 miles before needing repair or maintenance. Average ICE car lasts $133,000 miles, often needing major repairs before then. Anyone who calls themselve a ""fiscal"" conservative should be onboard with EVs at this point, as it's cheaper over the life of the car. You can also get 20 to 80% charge in under 20 minutes in a tesla, some other car brands are now down to 10 minutes. Please actually do your own research and math.

Like you, I believe that this case had an appropriate and common-sense outcome in the High Court of Australia.  However, I can't help but take issue regarding a number of background issues you highlighted:
1.  Owners/drivers were not required to maintain a log book, rather they were required to provide two verifiable photos of the odometer, the first from the beginning of the year and the second from the end of the year,
2.  I don't believe that Daniel Andrews resigned because of this impending decision and I believe there is no proof to support that claim, 
3.  The uptake of electric vehicles will impact the incidence of heart disease, respiratory diseases, possibly some autoimmune diseases and some cancers...it's not a long list, but it is an impactful list in terms of the burden of disease in Australia and elsewhere, and 
4.  Generally speaking, the Commonwealth Government is only responsible for those matters enumerated in Section 51 of the Constitution.  The Australian Constitution does not address road construction or maintenance in any way shape or form.  Consequently is wrong to claim that the Commonwealth is responsible.  However, the Federal Government is able to make grants available to the States and such grants may be for specific purposes, such as road construction.  This grant is a supplement to the State Governments in fulfilling their responsibility for such matters, or building the road to a specified standard, possibly for defence or facilitating interstate trade (both matters for which the Federal Govt is responsible).
I enjoy your commentary on developments as the world and Australia shift from a carbon-based economy, but your commentary should be accurate and display less of a possible political bias(?), which detracts from an otherwise good observational opinion.

Vehicle types could be grouped in one of a handful of categories and tax rates, just as happens in the U.K. and in a number of other countries. The figures involved would be standardised and easy to administer either online, via post offices or by post. Any vehicle which is due to be taxed would be put onto a state or national database, and any owner who has not taxed their vehicle(s) would be flagged immediately by the database. A SORN system (Statutory Off Road Notification) option would allow for people who are either scrapping their vehicle or only going to be using it on private land. Those vehicles would also be flagged if they are seen being used on public roads. Reasonably easy to police in this computerised world, and very efficient, if done properly.

The repealed tax was, or would have been, a nightmare for government employees to calculate, check, bill and collect. Can you imagine the mayhem which would be caused in trying to ensure that each driver of each of their vehicles kept accurate records of every journey throughout each year, and then submitted them on time and with no errors? Then who would have to be paid to handle the ensuing queries and disputes? And who would have to be paid to police it?

The whole thing would be incredibly inefficient and chaotic, especially if many people objected to the tax, as they clearly did. And even if they didn't object, then how many of us have imperfect memories, and make mistakes and omissions? I know of nobody who is absolutely perfect! Let's face it, many people have little idea about how much money they spend in each retail outlet each week, and few keep scrupulously accurate records of even simple and regular expenses.

2. You do NOT need to tell the Govt WHERE you are going to.
3. People did not have their licence REVOKED for not complying, what actually happened is people had their car registration cancelled - meaning, if you had a crash you were personally liable for all damages, including for your own car because you were effectively driving around uninsured.  
4. The Vic EV tax is not 2.5c/km it is 2.8 cents.

ZLEV road-user charge update	 
18 October 2023

Dear valued VicRoads customer,

The High Court has handed down its decision in relation to the Victorian zero & low emission vehicles (ZLEV) road-user charge.

Given the complexity it may some time to work through what this means for you. We thank you for your patience.

We are committed to continuing to inform ZLEV customers what the decision means for them and the next steps we will take.

Please note if you are a business customer who works with a Fleet Manager, you should advise them directly if you have any ZLEV vehicles which may be impacted.

Motorists who are due to renew their zero and low emission vehicle (ZLEV) registration should continue to do so.

We will continue to provide advice to all our customers as quickly as possible to minimise any inconvenience or confusion.

In the meantime, please visit www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/registration/registration-fees/zlev-road-user-charge for further information.

If you have any questions in relation to the ZLEV road user charge, please contact: 1300 554 857

So that basically means tax-free driving for about 7 to 8 years for a new EV. I think incentives for switching to EVs are entirely appropriate, especially when you consider the very high hidden costs of fossil fuels, which include pollution, massive tax subsidies for oil exploration and production, and even the cost of military security in places like the Middle East to keep an oil supply.

Those who failed to comply had the vehicle registration cancelled, not the drivers licence.

In order to comply, a photo of the odometer was required. It may have been that a log book could be used, but this was overkill and not essential. After all, why would the government care when and where you drove if all that mattered was how many kilometres you drove in the year?

Road funding is supplied by all three levels of government. Local councils are responsible for basically the suburban or town streets. The state government is responsible for major roads with the federal government chipping in for some major projects. I'd hate anyone to walk away thinking that the Victorian government was taxing people to pay for road funding they didn't do. Also, the federal fuel excise goes into general revenue and the funding it provides for roads is drawn from that source. It's not as if the fuel excise goes 100% into roads and when the fuel money runs out, funding runs out. It doesn't work like that.

The EV tax, while being the tax that instigated the High Court case, was not the only tax that is impacted. At the time of federation, the states ceded a number of taxation types to the federal government. Relevant to this case were taxes related to the production, manufacture, sale, distribution, or consumption of goods. This was a tax on the 'consumption' of the roads. Those from the US may find it unusual that we have no state sales tax. This is why.

As Sam said, Victoria was the first state to go down this path but others were certain to follow. My guess is that the decision will also block state congestion taxes, another idea that has been floated over the years.

Finally, I think we can do without the political commentaries. Yes, getting rid of this tax was a good thing. Yes, there will need to be some restructuring of taxes in general to cover road funding. Yes, the loss of the fuel excise will leave a hole in federal finances. As for the rest of the political commentary, it is best left out of the videos as much of it is dubious to say the least.",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:08.876535,0.0

No difficult and time consuming tasks and I'm fairly sure it was only a small number of people that had their registrations cancelled indefinitely for not complying.

But the commonwealth government can, and that leads to a bigger issue - that they are addicted to the money that comes from the sale of polluting fuels, which they might try to replace. I hope the Greens will keep the lid on that idea, if it ever arises.

Also, for the record, the High Court didn't use any morally condemnatory language to characterise the EV tax.

There costly here in the United States based on income of the average household. Households are struggling with higher interest rates on limited housing. So, paying 65,000 for a Tesla Car is prohibitive. The infrastructure; insufficient generating power supplies , 
Charging outlets are limited, 
Conductivity of our power lines is another factor which no one is discussing. Lastly power costs are jumping 20 to 40% is various electric markets!! Once again taking money from consumers pockets!! Then we move to the outrageous costs of replace these car batteries, $ 10,000.00. These batteries
Are a hazardous waste product as they are replaced!!! Another driving up cost is upgrading the power grids across our nation and consumers are being asked to pay for this Hugh improvement. So, without government support  in subsidies and tax breaks 
This will be a dead on arrival 
Product. Hydrogen and hybrid cars maybe offer a better product mix. Hybrids allows for a usage of existing technologies which the average consumer can handle based on wages!  Hydrogen development is about ten years away so it will allow for a building up supply chain sources and a cleaner source for transportation. The other aspect is developing a EV tractors for food production is a ""no go"" based on current technologies to put it in the fields. The cost of these tractors will be out of reach of most small growers, just like the current cost of the Tesla Car!! 
EV cars will need to be in the 28,000 to 32,000 range to allow customer demand to grow!!!",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:17.333033,0.0

I'll explain.  First, finances and economy.  In the United States, the average income in the U.S. is $37,000, which is only up $3,000 from 12 years ago.  The Median income is about $57,000.  Let's differentiate here because it's important.  This is a great definition of the difference between the two:  ""The average is calculated by adding up all of the individual values and dividing this total by the number of observations. The median is calculated by taking the “middle” value, the value for which half of the observations are larger and half are smaller.""  
But, the average cost of a vehicle has gone insane, as with food, housing, and all the other costs of living.  In January 2012, the average cost of an automobile was $30,570, in March of 2023 it was almost $49,000, or over a 60% increase in price.  It is not really possible for most people to purchase a new car today, and really, to purchase a new car, finance it for so many years, and still have enough money to meet other needs, i.e., housing, food, medical, and retirement, you need to be making about $200,000 a year.  This is starting to sink in.  When you go into a dealership and you have to put down $8,000 as the downpayment on a new car, and if you have really good credit, you might get a car loan as low as 6.34%.
So, let's say I want to buy a new Toyota Crown, let's say I got a good deal, and it's going to cost me $45,000.  I have a 60-month loan at 6.34%.  I am able to put down $9,000, in either cash or trade.  I live in a West Coast blue state that has a tax of 10%.  My loan amount is $36,500, my sales tax is $4,550 and my upfront payment is $14,550.  The Interest on the loan is $6,186, and my loan payments over 60 months are $42,685 for a total cost of $57,236.  That works out to a car payment of $711.43 per month.  In your first year, you will pay $6,407 in principal and $2,130 in interest.
Most people today can not afford that.  Also, used car prices are insane, but your trade-in value has not substantially increased.

So many years ago, when I was in school, we were taught that our housing costs, including rent and utilities or mortgage and utilities, should not be more than 25% of our income.  Back around 2010, and even before, that number was raised to 33%.  Today, people are paying in excess of 50% of their income for housing.  Even if you make the Median Income of $57,000, that only gives you $1,100 per week.  Given the rule of thumb I was taught in school, your mortgage or rent, including utilities, shouldn't be more than $1,100 or so per month.  As an example, I said I live on the West Coast.  In 2008, I purchased a 2 bed, 1.75 bath, 1,000sf condo for $137,500.  Today, a condo in that same complex is pending sale for $315,000!  My mortgage payment with a no-money down VA loan was less than $800 a month, plus a $500 HOA fee.  With a 20% down payment ($63,000) that condo would cost $2,320 per month plus the $500 or so per month Condo fee.  That's $33,840 per year with a mortgage rate of 8.219% for a 30-year mortgage.   For that 25% rule of thumb, you'd need to be making about $136,000 per year, or $101,500 if you use 33%.  This is a two-bedroom condo!  Imagine adding $8,500 to that to pay for your car.  That's $44,000+ per year just for a two-bedroom condo and your car.

How many people, really, have the ability to make that kind of payment.  Okay, I don't live in those condos any more, but the one I lived in had 12 units in my building, and some of the other buildings had 18 units per building.  They all were set back from the parking lot and we didn't have any garages.  So, now, you're going to have to charge your car.  That means installing a charging station.  Each one of the units had one assigned parking spot.  You would need to install a charging station for each unit, whether or not they had an EV, because you didn't know if they were going to buy one or not.  It would be difficult, if not downright impossible to feasibly install the power for the charging station to go to each unit, at least with any fiscal responsibility.  That means that the condo association would probably have to provide the power to the charges, and you could be paying a monthly fee for the electricity that you used to the Homeowner's Association.  The fiscal hurt of that would have to be absorbed by the owners, regardless of whether they had an EV or not.  How much would that add to your HOA fee (remember, this one is already at $500 per month).
If you have a home of your own, then you'd just pay an electrician a couple of thousand dollars to come out and install your $500 charging station.

While EV sales are strong, right now, they are slacking off.  Prices continue to rise, moving them out of the reach of the people they need to be selling to the most.  The price IS falling, the average cost of an EV in the U.S. is only about $54,000, down from a year ago.  But, then again, the average cost of an ICE car is $48,000.  So, really not too much of a difference.

Then there is the reliablity.  Tesla is probably the largest EV car manufacturer in the world, and how many of their cars, for no apparent reason, just have a battery fault and burst into flames?  Ooops, my $54,000 car just burned up.  There are some insurance companies now refusing to insure EVs.  If an EV gets into an accident, it often is considered 'totaled' even though comparable damage on an ICE vehicle would be repaired and paid for, the chief reason being the cost of the battery.  Any minor damage to the battery risks a short, fire or other damage resulting in the loss of the car.  So, if the battery is damaged at all, the entire cost of the automobile is written off.  Hence, the cost of insuring an EV is more.",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:17.334131,1.0

Current battery technology is expensive, has safety issues, has range issues, has cold weather performance issues, and some ecological and humanitarian issues. Those are a lot of issues to overcome... and yet, we are on the cusp. There are new technologies that are just now becoming available and even newer technologies on the horizon that will resolve all of these issues.
When it is cheaper to buy an EV than an ICEV, and when the range of the battery will be 3 to 4 times that of an ICEV,  no one will have to *MAKE* people switch. Most people will not even really care that their new car has a lower carbon footprint. ICEVs will go the way of telephone booths - for the same reason.

My mother who lives in Bangladesh still has a 30 years old Toyota crossover SUV. I remember my first car a 1988 Toyota Camry. I love that car because I can go ahead and repair it myself since all the parts are available everywhere and it's easy to access parts. With an electric car the first challenge is that the battery won't last past 10 years if it survives past 5 years. Toyota has a program where they will replace your battery if it dies before 10 years or 150,000 miles. What Toyota love to do is to have both options a battery and a gas engine just like my Toyota RAV4 prime. This way if the battery dies then switch over to the gas engine which has 16 gallons of gas which gives you about 450 miles. The car itself has an 18 kilowatt battery which is good enough for 50 miles. I fill up my car every other month due to the hybrid system switch between the battery and gas when I run out of battery power. The regenerative brake works amazing. Hopefully with the solid state battery they can make RAV4 prime go 200 miles on battery instead of 50. Toyota wants to make a car that you can use continuously for days if you need to because that is true freedom of using a car. The car should wait for you to get ready, you should not be waiting for the car to finish charging. I think moving forward the future will be Toyota car battery will get you a long way with the solar roof slowing down the discharge rate during daytime and the regenerative brakes helps putting some power back into the battery. when you run out of battery, it will continue driving with gas. I have a solar roof so I'm basically getting the power for free.",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:17.647021,0.0

question, do you want eternal life?
If you believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, was buried and rose again on the third day, then you are a Christian and you have eternal life!
That's the Gospel!
By the way, Gospel means “the Good News” and you can find it here: 1 Corinthians 15:1-4
""1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:""
You can only receive eternal life through Jesus Christ aka God: John 14:6
“Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” ""
Imagine this, God himself took the form of a mortal man, lived a sinless life and died for you on the cross, paying with his blood for all your sins, for all your mistakes, for all the wrongs you have done to others !
Jesus, who is the Christ, loves you so much that he died for you and that you may have eternal life!
Do you know someone else who loves you as much as Jesus Christ?
John 3:16
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Maranatha

The mining contains radioactive waste and lots of CO2, prevents them from being CO2 neutral. There is not enough materials to even replace current car fleet.  

In contrast, new combustion tech will be 75% with CO2 capture and recycling.  Make fuel from RE for $1/gal at home and save $2.2/gal by capturing the CO2 ON THE CAR.  Let the house solar make fuel while the car drives.  6000/8400 mile range with 60 gallons of Ethanol/gasoline in 6 minutes.  E-Ethanol from home or gasoline while on the road if needed.  

No EV comes close.  RE fuels are 1% of the CO2 of a battery and when battery + grid is considered, RE fuels with this new tech is 200 times less CO2 for energy input.  

A 100% RE grid will be 60 cents/kwh vs fuel at at home for 3 cents/kwh or 20:1.  EVs require a grid to charge, but fuel making does not as it works slowly day in and day out.

The KEY to RE is fuel making.  E-Fuel made with RE or nuclear IS the ""battery"" of the future of transit.  

Nuclear power can make fuel at the plant for around 4-5 cents/kwh with free CO2 capture from cars, or about 11-12 cents/kwh with air CO2 capture.  That is a range of 4.5 to 11.5 cent/kwh.  Retail would be around 15 cent/kwh retail ($5/gal).  The grid will be 60 cents/kwh ($20/gallon equiv) or 4 times more than making fuel at the plant.  So, 4:1

This new engine tech can get 75% to 90% of the fuel needs gone while still using gasoline.  75% with old heavy cars, or 90% with all new designs optimized for this tech.

An EV can only reduce CO2 by 33% with a 100% RE grid, vs this tech at 75 to 90% with gasoline.  Use RE fuels?  98% of CO2 GONE.  At no time will an EV beat this new combustion tech.",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:19.184303,0.0

1. No reliable and robust electrical infrastructure in large parts of Asia and Africa. Green infrastructure is the most expensive to build, and while there is good economic logic for doing so, the best infrastructure takes money from capitalist and puts in small communities where financing is a 

2. Japan has had major problems with its electrical infrastructure since 2011 and are reluctant to keep nuclear power plants in full operation. 

3. The US, Canada and Russia, which have more than adequate area for green energy production are basically leaving green energy production to the consumer. This means the consumer needs to provide on the roof of their houses enough solar panels to charge their cars and household. In a typical house the cars leave in the morning and come back in the evening, when the panels are idle. Without a redundant battery yo are still pulling power off the grid. There is also the problem of panel vulnerability in coastal communities. 

4. The Europeans are overproducing electric cars putting the firiegn manufactorers at a disadvantage. 

5. The prius is a very successful vehical and can be converted to an all electric vehical for light driving. 

In the US only about 1/3rd of fossil fuels are use by transportation. Another 1/3 is used by industry and commerial, and 1/3rd is electric power generation. Only the electric power sector has dropped consumption and not significantly. Much of the energy used in the world is used in home heating. 

If you really want to help your pocket and the world, repair you leaky home and insulate it. In cold climates they recommend R19 in the walls and >R40 in the attic. High quality double pane windows block heat transfer. Get those electric use numbers down and the green electricity on the grid will go farther. When replacing the HVAC, think about replacing the ductwork and getting a high SEER system. With a better insulated house you might consider stepping down the condensor a bit.

You missed the subject by trying to make a video to be just popular, please make unbiased videos, equal comparison, you need an unselfish motive and great intelligence to be applied for it. 
The top end auto petrol is @15.5 lakhs and the top end prime model ev is 17.6 lakhs. Hence this difference is nothing in real life. I have a 10yr old ev in use and the range is reduced by just 10% but no need to replace the battery for a few years, also the battery price has reduced from 4.5 to 2.25 lakhs. To note the prices of the nexon battery shall be less than half in the next 8 yrs, and old batteries can be used as huge battery banks in inverters for the next 10 yrs. 
Your petrol costs 10rs per km and Nexon ev costs less than 1 rupee per km, maintenance is 4500 for your petrol vehicle per 3 months and for nexon ev is rupees 1500 after 20000 km. 

Ev users are environment and range conscious hence lighter on foot, hence utilize less tyre. 

Please upgrade and I request you to make a video to bring these facts in real and show you are real not fake. 

Do you know how stress free ev is in traffic and after coming home?

Nexon EV starts with XM variant at 15.3 L on road.

Nexton petrol XM variant is ₹10.4L on road.

And since EV is non geared, it should be compared with XMA version i.e. automatic which is 11.25 lacs on road.

Price difference 4 lacs and not 7.5 lacs as claimed in your ill researched video. 

Running cost is petrol (mileage -12-13km/l)  ₹8-9/km 
Electric 1-1.5₹/km

Difference aprx ₹7/km.

To recover additional ₹4 lacs one has to run only less than 60 K km’s.

Most cars have a life of at least 2,00,000-250,000 km’s. Even if you don’t use it for that long it’s resale value will be much higher than that of petrol car.

But that is for manual. If you are comparing with an ev atleast compare with petrol base automatic varient, which for nexon is XMA that comes for 11.5 lacs.
Nexon ev base varient is EV prime XM which comes for 15.4 lacs and has better features.  On top of this you also get a tax refund of 1.5 lacs which comes around atleast 1 lac or more  based on your tax bracket. So effectively your ev cars cost will come up to 14.5 to 14 lacs. Now this is a difference of about 2.5 to 3 lac.
So by your calculation if one saves 6 rs per km. One has to drive for 40k to 50k kms to recover cost . If you drive 600 km per month, roughly 15 to 20 km per day, you will break even in 5 to 6 years . Additionally you don't have mentainance heavy parts like clutch plate, engine, fuel transmission etc, so you will save atleast 30 to 40k per year on maintenance after first year.

The battery warranty is for 1,50,000 km in ev, so let's our goal is 1.5L km.

For petrol, milage: 17km, price: 97/-
So running cost = 1,50,000/17×97 = 8,55,882/- ( on current fuel price ) 
Maintenance cost at per 10k km = 4,000/- ( min )
So for 1.5L km = 4,000×15 = 60,000/-

Total = 8,55,882 + 60,000 = 9,15,882/- ( min )

For EV, milage: 300km, price for 1 unit : 7/- ( min )
Running cost for 1.5L km = 1,50,000÷300×40×7 = 1,40,000/- 
Maintenance cost = 60,000 ( max ) 

Total = 1,40,000 + 60,000 = 2,00,000/-

1. **Battery Recycling**: Lithium hydroxide can be recycled from lithium-ion batteries by disassembling the batteries and extracting the lithium-containing components. These components are then subjected to processes such as leaching, precipitation, and filtering to separate and recover lithium compounds.

2. **Chemical Processes**: The recovered lithium hydroxide can undergo chemical processes to purify and regenerate the compound. This might involve dissolving the compound in water, then using chemical reactions to separate impurities and regenerate the pure lithium hydroxide.

3. **Electrochemical Methods**: Electrochemical processes can also be used to recycle lithium compounds. In some cases, lithium hydroxide can be electrochemically converted back into lithium metal, which can then be used to produce new lithium-ion batteries.

4. **Ion Exchange**: Ion exchange resins or membranes can be used to selectively extract and recover lithium ions from solutions containing lithium hydroxide. This method can be particularly useful for recycling lithium from industrial processes.

5. **Hydrometallurgical Techniques**: These techniques involve using various chemicals and processes to selectively dissolve lithium compounds, separate them from other materials, and then recover and purify the lithium hydroxide.

Recycling lithium hydroxide and other lithium compounds is important for reducing the environmental impact of lithium-ion batteries and conserving valuable resources.

China is a communist country where the labour or poor people can’t say anything against government. If u see their model, they literally exploit their workers. They use their workers as they want. No one can question government. No media or social media leaks anything happens inside their country. 
Chinese workers has to work without any increments for years. They can’t form any union. 

Is it possible in India? Never. We will and can’t do or act like China.

That’s why India or any other country can’t become a manufacturing hub like China. That’s the major problem.

And again, now since world has officially came to know about the white gold in India, just imagine what our enemies can do including China. So this is not so easy as you expect. But Modiji hai to Sab kuch mumkin hai.

New energy electric vehicles have three cores: power battery, electric drive and electric control. Among them, the mainstream of power battery is still lithium battery. Using sodium-ion batteries as power batteries is tantamount to changing the ""heart"" of electric vehicles, and the performance, quality and reliability of the entire vehicle will be affected.

However, the performance of this ""new heart"" is really impressive. The data shows that the battery capacity of the first sodium battery car in China is 25kWh, and the cruising range is 250km, which has a certain gap with the lithium electric car, but it is not a big problem to meet the urban commuting. And in terms of fast charging, sodium batteries only need 15-20 minutes to charge once, which is much better than lithium batteries!

 The sodium-ion batteries can cut the cost of battery by 30%.",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:36.619502,0.0

1) Buy an ev with all the subsidies like fame II , 80EEB and other state wise discounts/subsidies. If u think that then also ev's are expensive buy an test drive car which is legal and u will get 2% discount every 1000Km driven and u can claim extended warranty on that test drive car.

2) Put an solar plant on the top of ur house with the deduction amount and charge it without any cost.

3) Investment the fame II and state wise subsidy in mutual funds or small banks which gives higher rate of interest for 5 yrs and other 3yrs. So if u will need to change ur battery after 8 yrs or 160K Km then u can withdraw the invested money and can use tha money in replacing the battery if required.

Insurance companies know about the risks of EVs catching alight ,they may insure the ships That bring them to UK , And insurance companies have to get some of the money back Hence higher insurance premiums alround  . If you dont own an EV makes no difference you Still get hit with higher premiums .since the advent of EVs and lithium battery fires from People charging up E scooters , E bikes ect in doors along with Mobility scooters the Insurance hedge funds have had a hammering .

An EV cannot be put out with water ,Co2 or anything else ,when it catches alight the Exothermic reaction cannot be put out thats why its called a Thermic runaway they are left To burn out . One company in Bucharest makes big fire blankets big as tarp to mimimise the Effects but it still has to burn out .


 Ask the dealers what thermal runaway is ,they are not going to say oh yes this where the battery gets a short and the Lithium ignites the battery then heats up and produces it own oxygen & fuel so the fire just accelerates . And it cant be put with water or anything else ,Lithium & water do not mix , and a Co2 extingusher is of no use .

Then we have the insurance risks of charging your EV at home over night in a garage Adjacent to the house or worser still the garage is under the house .


There have been cases of freight ships that carrying EVs catching alight , they try to minimimse trhe insurance risk by only only carring 25 EVs at a time . One ship in Holland went up ,the fire teams could only spray water on the sides of the ship to stop the metal from heating up and loosing its strenth . the heat from Lithium is very intense especially in a confined place like onboard ship .

It may be the case for shipping the cars without the batteries & for the batteries to shipped separate ,either way the costs only goes up up and away ! /UK

None of this ever makes the GB news or Talk TV or the other news stations .
Point is if your selling somerging under the save the planet & being green they leave the risk section out of it let alone its affects on the Insurance markets & your pocket .

I guess it’s supposed to be a big secret that plants are carbon based life forms that require fertilizers (NPK) and pull carbon from the soil that was previously sequestered while they emit massive amounts of hydrocarbon based terpenes like highly volatile isoprene as well as carbon and sulphur based alkaloids, phenolics and polyketides like ethers, polyethers, and polyenes. Many of these compounds aerosolize and contribute ozone and smog and haze. While isoprene also breaks down into nitric oxide which is a major air pollutant. While eating a plant based diet also produces more flatulence producing more methane. I don’t know maybe I just told the secret.",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:46.329050,0.0

There is no climate crisis, it`s a huge scam. 
Stop all this stupid talk about cutting CO2 like it`s some kind of poison or pollutant, it isn`t, without it all life on this planet would die, the earth needs more not less. Every single prediction that these idiots have made over the last 100 years, not one has happened, NOT ONE!
 
The facts they don`t want you finding out.

Atmospheric CO2 is just 420 PPM of greenhouse gases, that`a the figure we`re told by the climate zealots. Water vapour is the main GHG at 98% (conveniently left out of the equation by climate zealots)  The important part of that figure is the ""PPM"" Parts Per Million 420 they tell us, dead easy to work out for anyone with the intelligence to use a calculator or any one of these brainwashed, leftie Chicken Littles. That equates to 0.00042%, and the human part of that 0.00042% is around 2%. That`s 2% of 0.00042. We add absolutely nothing whatsoever to GHG, it`s all a massive hoax to redistribute wealth from we the people to they the MONEY COLLECTORS. and they are ably assisted by, their ""Useful idiots"" which are.... stupid and lazy media outlets, Hollywood luvvies and  brainwashed/groomed schoolchildren!!!

The issue of our modern times is not CO2. It is pollution. That is what we must control. Plastics, human sewage, water contamination, industrial chemicals leeching into soils etc. 
Our climate has CONSTANTLY changed over 600 million years of life on planet earth. So even the wording of the Climate Change Alarmists is erroneous. They are pointing in the wrong direction. Instead, we need to learn to adapt to our worlds changing geological and climatological processes and stop trying to force it to do what WE want.

I have little respect for the ""Scientific community"" anymore. What good is ""peer review"" when the ""peers"" risk professional suicide if they disagree with anthropogenic climate change? What good is ""data"" when the NOAA admits they ""adjust"" data to agree with their predictions? Why is CO2 such a bogieman?  Why did we have 4 ice ages and why did they melt? Why does every ""scientific"" study utterly dismiss the ""Little ice age"" that occurred from 1300 through 1850 that caused, among other things, the Irish Potato famine? And the medieval warm period of 950 to 1250?
The fact remains that virtually nothing has happened in our climate that can't be explained as nothing more than natural cyclic changes. Is the climate warming now? Probably, but so what? The climate will always be either warming or cooling. The one thing that never happens is climate equilibrium, but nobody acknowledges that fact.
We are living in one of the most stable climatic periods the Earth has ever seen. The climate has been wildly unstable in the distant past with much higher CO2 levels than we have today. Incidentally, CO2 is wonderful for plants, contributes to crops and reforestation, and stabilizes-out cooler periods. When you have a moment, find a hard-copy vintage print article on Mount Pinatubo, Its eruption in 1991 spewed out more greenhouse gasses, noxious fumes and particulate into the atmosphere than humans ever had in our collective history AND, ever would at the rates current of the time in 100 years more. The effect was a change of about -1degree C for <2yr. This is absolutely profound. It demonstrates that our contribution to the climate is not even negligible.   The climate change issue is just rhetoric to create fear, which shifts power and money, trillions of dollars in subsidies for these newly created ""Green"" companies. This is why you can find this analysis only in print…. It’s an inconvenient fact that the tech giants and their political overlords would like to keep out of your hands. Politicians have picked the side that they can use to gain more and more control over all of us. 

So, have fun with all those carbon taxes and regulations, say goodbye to air conditioning….. because yes, they want to stop that too (except in their public offices) bye bye to your car, and if they kill off oil like they want to, say goodbye to plastic and every chemical…. EVER. It’s all petroleum.There are reams & reams of reports available that disprove any significant human contribution.

We are forced to abandon an infrastructure that provides liquid fuel and build another, at great expense, to supply this madcap idea that evs will be better for the environment.
The drawbacks, which are not  readily apparent,  are that to generate and distribute electricty is very inefficient.
The local area network, that is the low voltage part of the grid that supplies the consumer has, in most cases, insufficient capacity to supply all these ev chargers (and then add heat pumps which is lunacy) so very expensive uprating will be needed which all will have to pay for whether you own an ev or not in an increase in electrical bills.
The reason for this adoption is to reduce CO2 emissions but with our grid that will not happen. Evs and heat pumps are not green at all. Simply put, because gas generation increases with increased demand of all these evs and heat pumps mean an increase in CO2 emissions from generation.

Let's nerd out for just one moment to establish some basic concepts.
Every EV has a maximum charging rate, expressed in kilowatts (kW), that governs the amount of power it can accept from roadside fast chargers. For the bZ4X AWD Toyota provided, that's an uncompetitive 100 kW. The higher an EV's rating, the faster you can hypothetically charge  — so long as you find a charging plug whose rating is equal or greater.
But you don't always achieve that max charge rate due to the charger, the temperature of the battery, or, in my case, settings built into the vehicle itself. During my trip, the car never got close to 100 kW, leading to some excruciating charging times. The 2023 Toyota bZ4X AWD Limited. Tim Levin/Insider

I don't look at the European automotive industry, but rather at the domestic one, because I live in Poland. The truth is that we never played a significant role in the world of combustion motoring, and ours died with FSO and was full of archaic structures. First things first. After the war, the government decided to rebuild the Polish automotive industry, which dates back to 1918. The key problem for the government was the license to produce a car. Due to the pre-war cooperation of the Polish automotive industry with Fiat, they were talking to Fiat about the license production of the 1100 model, a small, relatively accessible family car. Unfortunately, in 1949, the contract was terminated for political reasons and in 1951, the FSO Warszawa, a licensed version of the Gaza M-20 Pobeda, went into production. The problem is that in the 1950s it was positioned much higher and was intended for politicians, state services and wealthy customers, and the FSC Żuk and ZSD Nysa, based on Soviet mechanics, were delivery vehicles. And society needed something economic. This is how the FSO/FSM Syrena was created, the only fully Polish design that was not without flaws, and it was in 1957. The only relatively recognizable brand was Polski Fiat, reactivated in the 1960s, but under which we promoted Italian technology and Italian cars. The Polish Fiat 125p, which debuted in 1967, was technically based on its predecessor, the 1300/1500, and was modernized many times. First, in 1973, the interim MR73 series appeared, followed by the MR75 series in 1975, produced until 1982. The result of such a policy of mindless pursuit of foreign exchange was an economic crisis that lasted throughout the 1980s and it was necessary to look for savings wherever possible. And since the license expired, in 1983 this angular sedan was called FSO 1500 and in the 1980s it was a much cheaper alternative to its much more expensive successor, FSO Polonez. Fiat 128 3p, Fiat 128 Sport and Fiat 132p were assembled at FSO. The Fiat 126p produced at FSM was an exact license of the original, and definitely the most successful one, because not only was it the cheapest and it brought motorization to the country, it also consumed little fuel and drove like a go-kart. The previously mentioned FSO Polonez, which was also an Italian project bought by FSO and previously rejected by Lancia, was more prestigious than its predecessor, the Fiat 125p, which was a cheaper alternative. The truth is that apart from the FSO/FSM Syrena, which was the only fully Polish car, the rest were either licensed versions or based on the floor plate and mechanics of either the Gaza M20 Pobieda or the Fiat 1300/1500 produced in the 1960s. The FSR Tarpan, a car primarily for farmers, and prototypes such as the Polski Fiat 125p Coupe, FSO 1300 Coupe, and FSO Ogar were also based on their technology. As FSM throughout its history only had its logo on the Syrena 105 taken over from FSO and its Bosto and R20 variants produced in 1971-1983, and had been producing the Polish Fiat 126p since 1973, in 1992 they were bought by Fiat and renamed them to Fiat. Auto Poland. Although the factory continues to operate, FSM itself has been closed. In 1994, the Polski Fiat brand made history. Volkswagen took over FSR, and after the Poznań factory went bankrupt, it was renamed Volkswagen Poznań. Meanwhile, at FSO, trade unions were demanding and ultimately the Korean concern Daewoo became the owner, which resulted in maintaining employment, modernizing the obsolete FSO Polonez, resulting in the Caro Plus series and producing cars such as Tico, Lanos, Matiz, Leganza, Nubira and Tacuma, which They were extremely popular in Poland. Unfortunately, the Daewoo concern itself was not reliable and went bankrupt in 2001, taking with it many manufacturers it owned, including FSO. Then Daewoo was bought by General Motors, which also had no idea for FSO apart from the licensed production of the Chevrolet Aveo, first in a sedan version, and then in a 3- and 5-door version. And here we come to 2009, when General Motors went bankrupt and the American government ordered them to purge them, so over the following years Opel, Vauxhall and Saab were sold (it went bankrupt in 2012), Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer, Daewoo and Holden were closed. , and in February 2011, production of the Chevrolet Aveo ended, and thus FSO went bankrupt and was one of the victims of the purge at General Motors. It is true that there was an intensive search for an investor, but nothing came of it. Currently, the only heir to FSO may be Izera, a manufacturer of electric cars, provided that the factory is built and everything goes according to plan. However, unlike western countries with huge automotive achievements, we have nothing to lose, because we do not have any automotive brand of our own, our internal combustion cars were very outdated compared to
Western competition, and our economy is far behind even those from the so-called old EU countries.  Only modernizations were Polish.  So we can ask ourselves what's the harm if we don't have our own car brand anyway, then in our Polish case, electrification and cooperation with China is an opportunity to draw conclusions from the past, bounce back from the economic bottom where we are now and avoid a number of mistakes made  by, among others, the no longer existing FSO.",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:56.637320,0.0

China decided to break away from the established technology and invest in completely new territory: cars powered entirely by batteries. 
For China, EVs also had the potential to solve several other major problems, like curbing its severe air pollution, reducing its reliance on imported oil, and helping to rebuild the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. 
It seemed like a win-win for China.
China took steps to invest in related technologies as early as 2001.
EV technology was introduced as a priority science research project in China’s Five-Year Plan, the country’s highest-level economic blueprint. 
Since then, EV development has been consistently prioritized in China’s national economic planning. 
About one-quarter of passenger cars sold in China last year were all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, compared with about 7% in the US.
China is way ahead of the US in terms of EV adoption.
China has implemented supportive policies to bolster the growth of the EV industry. 
In line with the dual-carbon target, China introduced the “New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021-2035)” on November 2, 2020.
China is by far the global leader in making EV batteries.
China is far ahead of the rest of the world in the development of batteries that use sodium, which are starting to compete with ubiquitous lithium power cells.
Today, fierce competition in China has spurred rapid development of the EV industry. 
China is both the largest auto and electric vehicle market in the world and home to an estimated 200 EV manufacturers. 
Faced with pressure and competition at home, China’s EV makers are pursuing expansion abroad, especially in emerging markets. 
Last year, China’s exports of EVs increased 131.8% year on year to around 680,000 units, official data showed.

As a Chinese who knows the automotive industry very well, I think many Germans or Europeans have not yet understood what is happening in China's current electric vehicle industry.
In the past 20 years, China has made continuous progress in the fields of lithium mining and processing, battery anode and cathode materials, metal materials and related processes, motors, and electronic controls (including but not limited to IGBT chips) through a large group of different types of enterprises. In fact, the advantages of the whole industry chain have been formed.
Notice! It is the advantage of the whole industry chain of the electric vehicle industry! Therefore, a certain electric vehicle brand or even a certain best-selling model entering the European market is only a sub-product of this industrial system.
As a traditional powerhouse of fuel vehicles, Germany's best choice at the moment is to cooperate with China's electric vehicle industry chain and at the same time give full play to its own advantages, such as cooperating in the research and development and production of Chinese electric vehicles in the hybrid field to jointly open up markets around the world. Develop your own new advantages.
Of course, what I think is the best option is actually known to my German colleagues.

I think the gasoline engines of German cars in the past 10 years have not been very good. In order to save fuel, turbocharging, direct injection, dual-clutch gearbox, 48V motor, etc. have been adopted. These technologies have brought a lot of minor problems, which have greatly reduced the long-term reliability of the car. Toyota's approach is very simple and reliable, using an additional motor and battery to form a hybrid system. Chinese cars now not only make EVs, but also produce many gasoline engines that match motors and batteries. The Chinese have found that motors and batteries can make up for many problems of gasoline engines and automatic transmissions, and can make gasoline engines more reliable.

It’s hard for me to say why German cars have become like this. It may be due to policy protection and labor union factors, which have allowed German cars to form a huge related industry.

1. The most popular electric car brands: BYD, Ideal, Xiaopeng, EA, Azure, Kryptonite, Gaohe, AITO, Avita, Great Wall, MG, Tesla, and so on, and the design is better than one, the competition is very fierce.
2. Electric car models include all models from sports car, crossover, SUV, MPV, A-C class. You should have heard of them.
3. China's charging facilities are now developing in the direction of high power and fast charging, 800KW is being popularized, which means that it only takes more than 10 minutes to charge an electric car to full capacity. Moreover, many new charging stations are using solar panels combined with storage batteries to reduce the operation and maintenance costs of charging stations.
4. China's charging pile equipment is now growing by tens and hundreds of thousands per month, you basically don't have to worry about charging in big cities, and charging piles have been built on all highways.
5. the most advanced self-driving system in China is the one developed by Huawei, which is mainly used in electric cars in the world of asking, and is a few blocks more advanced than Tesla's self-driving system, and there are all kinds of road test videos spreading like wildfire on China's social media (if you're interested, you can search for it on Tik Tok and watch it)

We do not have the technology so the whole concept is not supported by the people.  The ideology is fine, we want a cleaner planet but it must be liveable.  We do not have anything to replace gas and people can see the total stupidity in EVs which are not capable of doing the job and are far too dangerous to take seriously.  Good sound technology will come along if we do this sensibly rather that following the blue haired idiots running around screaming.  Wind and solar are not viable and are only being pushed because they are 100% dependent on the oil industry which sees plastics as its future.  They are supply driven unlike gas which is demand driven.  We need hydrogen to replace gas our power production and our cars but it must be done in a rational and cost efficient way.  The planet is much cleaner today and the planet is doing well but everyone buy a new car will do far more damage than it will solve.  50% of the pollution from an EV is during production so we are seriously increasing pollution not reducing it.  The lifespan of an EV is a third of that of an ICE so that pollution increase will remain.  Why are we focused on EV when there are other options?  When I drive to the UK from Poland in my diesel car I can get to Calais on biodiesel yet when I enter the UK I am forced to run on fossil fuel?   Then some idiot tells me that I should buy an EV which would mean that I would still be in a queue at the service station in Germany waiting to charge the stupid thing before it catches light.

Britain was happy to subsidise compensation for the slave owners when it 'abolished' slavery, yet are not willing to help with this MASSIVE transition and it's associated costs.

The cost of an EV is still prohibitive (not everyone can afford a 5k car, let alone 10k, and not everyone gets finance approved) and the cost of maintaining one is even worse, with insurance companies price gounging due to the expensive costs of repairing these vehicles.
Again, all things the government could be subsidising into, helping insurance companies claim some or most of the cost, putting price caps, subsidising the individual more than 2k (pathethic).

I haven't even started on the issue with national infrastructure regarding charging stations. Essentially 'forcing' EV owners to have a 'petrol' station at home to top up their own car. What happens to the millions of homes, apartments, HMOs that don't have driveways or have one drive way? Where is the infrastructure outside major cities? The UK is NOT London. This is a huge problem that needs a lot of money thrown in, which the government is not willing to give because shareholders and 'gotta-keep-the-billionnaires-happy', and of course the good old not taxing these major oil corporations that LITERALLY say they don’t know ""what to do with all the money"" (BP).",none,,2023-12-02 21:31:58.287165,1.0

80% of Minis are exported overseas. 109 countries purchase minis built in Oxford UK. 

In 2021 mini had its highest year in domestic sales, 46'000 new vehicles sold in the UK. That is against a background of currently 30 million passenger cars in the UK from all makers and 1 million new vehicles purchased per year. 

So minis domestic marketplace is small. 

The point here no one is emphasising is this. 

These UK based car manufacturers are not doing this green initiative to clean up Britain as the majority of sales are exported overseas.  
 
The manufacturers are doing it to meet carbon limits during manufacture so they avoid climate tarrifs but exporting greener vehicles overseas does nothing to lower vehicle emissions output within the UK by these domestic manufacturers. 

Exporting vehicles still requires large freight supersize container ships that burn diesel fuel. 

EV batteries still require highly toxic rare earth minerals and metals sourced in third world regions often mined by slave labour, underage labour in terrible working conditions. 
Regions such as war torn DRC in central Africa. 

The domestically sourced lithium is not enough to provide enough EV batteries to keep pace with UK vehicle production. 

A large part of the green initiative was to source and use locally.

Therefore this exercise falls short of being an adequate solution to tackling climate change.

While brief, it dived deeply into aspects that many 'Why China is so good at EV' articles/videos didn't. For instance, it is rarely mentioned that China's EV development can be dated back to early 2000s, not 2010s. 2010s was, at the video correctly identified, where this development is on the next gear, rather than its origin.

Still, a few points I'd like to add.

1. The development got its ups and downs. It's not just 'throw some money year after year and it's done'. There are setbacks. There are adjustments. The subsidy fraud thing was actually  quite serious then. There were others as well, like how to determine to best form of subsidy - it it consumer? Some form of quotas? Should it focus on big, advanced luxurious cars? Or should it be general? This is actually quite a journey and show the smart adaptation of the Chinese government

2. Speaking of the fierce internal competition, Tesla occupies an important role here. Tesla has been considered the best brand in China for a long time. So, in order to cut a share in the market, Chinese EV companies ha木 to directly compete against Tesla. This spurs great product development. They tried to chase Tesla in certain performance metrics, while developing new edges (like software integration, which is very very good). They also dominate the lower-end markets which is more price-sensitive. I think right now, Tesla is still considered the best, but BYD is a very close second. and 5 years ago this would sound ridiculous. That's what the competition has done.

3. The help on EV is far beyond just consumer subsidy. One thing: infrastructural buildup like charging stations, laws and regulation, suppression of ICE vehicles etc. China is basically leaps and bounds ahead of all countries, even European ones, in this regard. The infrastructural buildups is especially important - Imagine cutting 90% of gas station and see how it affects the ICE car market.

4. There's an underlying strategic logic behind China's massive and sustained investment in EV. The basic idea is that newcomers are hard to challenge established ones in existing market. The only way for China to get ahead of the technologically advanced west is to get into new products like EVs. That way, all countries have the same starting point, and in this case with smart policies and subsidies + a huge internal market, China could be very successful - and it did. This sort of thinking can date back even before 2000s - and in the early 2000s China decided to experiment and test out different fields and see which one is worth further developing - and EV is one of them, and the rest is history.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:10.362319,0.0

Also, China's state-owned partnerships with foreign businesses that allowed them to develop their automotive industry so fast were extremely protectionist.

Finally, China's reputation for trash quality may be surmountable for cheaper goods, even phones, but I don't think that's going to hold true for a major purchase like an automobile - at least not for Western consumers. Edit: also, I wouldn't class facial recognition as a (positive) feature in a car. We're in an era where consumers are pushing back heavily on manufacturers turning vehicles into smartphone-like devices in the hopes of getting some subscription revenue. Facial recognition in a car doesn't do anything a key already didn't, and many Western consumers don't want a Chinese company getting a facial scan of them.

Most of these incidents are actively ""quieted"" by BYD and the other manufacturers, however even after all these media control, the number of publicized EV fires are still worrysome. In addition, most of the ""new"" Chinese EV brands will die off in the next few years due to severe competition, and new technologies are being developed quickly. If I were back in the US or Europe, I would stay away from these brands for a few years, maybe the only exception is the Wu Ling Hong Guang Mini (for about $5000-7000), which battery is just too ""small"" to start a fire and has a good track record (many sales, with very few fires) in China.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:11.040688,0.0

As someone living in eastern europe I've seen a lot of model 3 Tesla rather than anything coming from a chinese car company, let alone a chinese EV.
The closest thing to it is the Dacia Spring which as mentioned in the video is produced in china but considering the region it feels more like people buying what they know rather than them picking a chinese built EV. And to make it clear, Dacia is not known for being particularly good but for being cheap and having easy to find parts.

The real issue with cars is the amount of time it takes to build up the brand to the point that the customers feel comfortable buying them. KIA is a great example of this with them selling cars here at extremely low prices for close to a decade before they gained any reasonable amount of marketshare.

Re: Chinese car and combustion, a lot of this comes from SerpentZA and while I am not a big fan of China and have watched him for years, I doubt SerpentZA knows or cares much about what is happening in EV market in China or anywhere else, Electric Viking or Bjørn Nyland he is not :D. For example, 5 years can be a lifetime for Chinese product quality. Maybe 5 or 4 year old Chinese EVs may combust en masse, as they were not meant to be exported and they were cutting corners. It's the same as with cell/mobile phones here in Europe, 5 years before their arrival everyone said ''ah Chinese phones are crap, battery does not last long'' etc. But 5 years after that significant % of people in Europe had Chinese phones and found them to be... fine. Not extraordinary (aside for price sometimes), but fine. 
I actually argued with SerpentZA saying that most Western car makers use Chinese batteries in their cars today and he of course said that Western car makers have better safety standards etc., and yes, it is maybe so that it was the case 4 or 5 years ago but if they want to export they will have to sort the issues out, they have hired TONS of industry experts from North America and Europe to help with various issues in car manufacturing. Chinese phones are not blowing up, so why would Chinese EVs. 
Before somebody says I am a Xi or China shill, I am actually the opposite of it. I just don't like that we in USA and Europe are complacent and sort of think that ''ah these cars are crap and they will never sell good'' while the Chinese are working hard to make them well. Instead of focusing what is combusting where and how these prices they sell the cars at are possible, the automakers in the West should instead focus on making a good product but few automakers here even have a good dedicated EV platform, I am not even talking about making their own batteries (as BYD do). Just because somebody has 100 years of experience in making ICE cars will not translate to success with EVs automatically, as ICE has nothing to do with Lithium or other kind of batteries and the whole way how you create an EV is quite a ways different taking into account the different components than putting together an ICE car. People are shocked that Tesla sells cars because of often shoddy workmanship, but Tesla sells them because they have supercharger network that is good enough and software that just works, meanwhile VW has Electrify America charge network that oftentime sucks ass as I have heard and software that does not work.

For a perspective, if your drive 100,000 km, your EV would cost you around 150 - 200 k while your petrol car would cost 750 - 800 k which is around 600 k more than an EV. 
Now, here's the catch. EV's are generally that much costlier than petrol cars. Can you save money? No, you can't, because saving that money would take around 5-6 years, given your car is continuously in use. 
It's better to stick with petrol cars until and unless the prices come down - maybe wait for government subsidies too.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:12.617590,0.0

The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration is part of the US Department of Transportation. Their webpage has all types of headlines and slogans like “Safe cars save lives”. “Protect your loved ones” with a photo of a baby in a car seat. 

Thousands of electric vehicles were underwater due to the hurricane flood surges. Many of of these batteries are spontaneously bursting into intense flames. The battery cases do not stand up well once submerged. Homes are burning down due to this. 

No where on the NHTSA is there a warning or a warning link about hurricanes and EV fires. I had to do a search on “hurricane” on the NHTSA webpage AND STILL NO WARNINGS. I clicked on one of the links and after scrolling down several times I finally found a Q&A. 

One question was “What should I do if the battery in my electric vehicle gets wet?” Now you still must do another click to see the answer. Here is the answer:

“The batteries in hybrid and electric vehicles are highly corrosive and should not be exposed to standing water. Flooded vehicles may have high voltage and short circuits that can shock and cause fires. Do not park a damaged vehicle with a lithium-ion battery in a garage or within 50 feet of your house or other structure, another vehicle, or combustibles. If you suspect your battery has been damaged, contact your dealer.”

Nor are there any warnings about how nasty and intense EV battery fires are! Even after pouring 1000s of gallons of water on the fire to stop it, the fires will spontaneously reignite! There are a lot chemicals inside 1000# EV batteries to burn. When paper and wood are soaked with water, the fire is over. Not so with the chemicals inside EV batteries! Some fire departments have reported even while pouring over 10,000 gallons over the battery, it reignited aver 10 times. And the fumes are extremely toxic. 

Battery cases in EV cars can easily be cracked in auto accidents. When air hits the chemicals inside, the batteries can ignite into flames. But that is another story.

What it means is we are all stranded because there would be no way to charge the  vast majority of cars after our grids are shut down by the magnetic pulse. What we need to do is revert to hybrids and to also utilize old tech of the sixties that are not affected by electro-magnetic pulse weapons. We also need to build a dozen or more new oil refineries,  open all oil fields and get gas prices back down to 2 dollars a gallon. Then we levy a 30 cent tax on each gallon and use the proceeds to build the infrastructure for hydrogen powered and electric powered  vehicles. Once the infrastructure is in place and all its solar, wind and tidal power systems are in place, we can expect to pay about 2 dollars a gallon for a very environmentally friendly, never ending source of energy.  We extract it from salt water. We also freeze the price of oil at 45 dollars a barrel and add in cost of living increases to it on an annual basis. Before it reaches 80 dollars a barrel, we will be very close to completing said infrastructure. This will probably  take around thirty years to complete, then we start the process all over again with a complete rebuild of said infrastructure, but in the mean time we keep the system properly maintained. All of which equals jobs, jobs, jobs and more jobs, cheap energy, energy independence, no need to go to war over oil, a very healthy environment and a very good quality of life for all Americans. We and Japan, which is already on this path, act as examples for the world to follow.  We also need to convince auto manufactures to manufacture inexpensive micro hybrids for in and around city driving, that get 80 miles to the gallon and can reach top speeds of 75 and all come with a bank of capacitors for quick on demand passing power. And again, use old tech ignition systems or hardened systems not affected by electromagnetic pulse weapons. And last of all, we need to take huge steps not to buy Chinese products. The intentions of the Chinese government is not good for world peace. If we deprive them of our money, they will not be able to afford to wage war.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:29.967350,1.0

I have coworkers that drive EVs and it's a mixed bag. Talk to people with solar panels on their homes and it will surprise you how inefficient those panels become over the years. Let alone what it cost to dispose of those panels.

Last year the U.S. bought 78% of its cobalt and all of its graphite from China in 2019, Chinese chemical companies accounted for 80% of the world’s total output of raw materials for advanced batteries. Of the 136 lithium ion battery plants in existence 101 are owned by the Chinese government. lithium-ion batteries depends on some key materials like graphite, the material used in pencil tips. In 2019, China produced more than 60% of the world’s graphite, according to U.S. government research. That means Beijing can set the prices and not sell to countries with sanctions against them. Cobalt has emerged as one of the hottest commodities in the new energy revolution because it is widely used in electric vehicles as well as computer and consumer electronics. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) produces more than 60% of the world’s mined cobalt. But Beijing controls the global supply of this silvery-blue metal.

eight of the 14 largest cobalt mines in the DRC are Chinese-owned and account for almost half of the country’s output.

China’s influence dominates cobalt processing with Chinese companies controlling about 80% of the cobalt refining industry, where it is turned into commercial-grade cobalt metal and power, according to Benchmark Minerals.

China's Tianqi Lithium now owns 51% of the world’s largest lithium reserve, Australia’s Greenbushes lithium mine. In 2018, the same company also paid about $4 billion to become the second-largest shareholder in Sociedad Química y Minera (SQM), the largest lithium producer in Chile.
In other words if we sanction china with semiconductors like we did, they can refuse to sell to us or charge any amount they want and the US has no other choice. If the U.S. doesn’t drop the sanctions and beg China to do business there will be no electric cars in the US in the very near future.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:32.943317,0.0

However, it has faced challenges when it comes to selling its EVs in the United States.

One reason for this is that the US market is highly competitive, and there are already many established players in the EV space, such as Tesla, General Motors, and Ford. These companies have large marketing budgets and established sales channels, which can make it difficult for a new player like BYD to gain a foothold.

Another reason is that there have been concerns about the quality of Chinese-made products, including electric cars. The US government has raised concerns about Chinese companies using stolen technology, and there have also been concerns about the safety of Chinese-made electric cars.

Additionally, there are regulatory barriers that BYD and other Chinese automakers face when trying to enter the US market. For example, they must comply with US safety and emissions regulations, which can be costly and time-consuming.

U.S. oil and gas subsidies include provisions ranging from incentives for domestic production, write-offs and deductions tied to foreign production and income, and approved accounting methods that can reduce the stated taxable value of assets.

One specific U.S. tax break on domestic production, for example, called intangible drilling costs, allows producers to deduct a majority of their costs from drilling new wells. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan panel of Congress, has estimated that eliminating it could generate $13 billion for the public coffers over 10 years, significantly more than any subsidies in place or proposedproposed for EVs.
Addidionally the ff industry has never accepted responsibility for the amount of damage caused by their extraction, processing or use. Some of those costs include enabling dangerous governments, causing wars, polluting of water ways, the air and soil with unhealthy chemicals reducing life spans of humans and killing literally millions of other species.

- EVs are superior in many ways to ICEs. As a matter of fact, most people who start driving EVs don't want to go back to ICEs because of the vastly superior driving experience.
- From gvt perspective, relying on oil makes you much more vulnerable to short term shocks than relying on renewables. (Yes, renewables create dependence on imports of rare earths etc, but these are long-term challenges that can be managed more easily than short-term oil shocks)
- Besides climate benefits, air quality improvements are worth billions in saved healthcare costs (for both private and public sector) but those are externalities to ICEs and there is no level playing field without government intervention. (this is true - though not as much- even as power is generated from fossil fuels, since the well-to-wheel efficiency of EVs is much more efficient than ICEs)

However, there are significant barriers to EV adoption, that require government intervention.
- First, acquisition costs of EVs are much higher. Though costs have come down significantly over the last years, there is still some way to go, that require (temporarily subsidised) demand so technological learning can do it's thing
- People are used to compare acquisition costs of new cars, where ICEs have an advantage. When doing the proper math of TCO (Total cost of Ownership) which includes energy and maintenance, EVs are a lot more attractive and in many cases more competitive. This requires time and education, and yes, an initial push by government programs.
- Range anxiety is a real thing and needs to be addressed by both manufacturers making more efficient batteries and deployment of public (fast) charging infrastructure. This requires subsidies before network effects take over (enough EVs to justify commercial investments in charging infra and vice-versa)",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:42.872774,1.0

A lot of infrastructure for power terminals is needed and furthermore the batteries arent there yet. Not to mention the cars are way slower, you can also see this in Formula 1 (they have shenanigans like the DRS, or speed boosters in the electrical-only categories. Even with the aerodynamics vast improvements, the F1 cars are way slower than the previous models).
Also electric car manufacturers have been entangled in various scandals in 3rd world countries, with cars that are not up to par. Some electric automobile companies have also gone under.
Electric energy is getting more expensive now and who knows it may get more expensive in the future. Already various nations are starting to burn coal again (Great Britain, Germany, Australia, Canada, USA and so on etc). Do note that most of these nations had supposedly strict timetables by 2026-2030, they have already extended the timetables.
Can they nations even keep up with the electric power demand (when every vehicle is electric or hybrid) when they cant now?
Or the predictions and the comments various politician/technology experts about the national power network borrowing electric power from individual owners for a small discount will come to pass sooner than later (Elon Musk & US officials have commented on this).
So far all that has been done is the new extra emission regulation cost, that will all but make extinct the smaller price models.

EV sales have been increasing several percent a year every year.  Any country whose people can afford to buy EVs (with or without the government subsidies) is selling A LOT OF EVs.  Just count the number of Teslas you see during your commute to work and while you are doing that, see if you can spot EVs from other manufacturers too.  Year after year that count goes up from 3%, to 6%, and this year it's expected to be 10% of the vehicle market.

Tax incentives for EVs are NOT a bribe to get consumers to buy an EV, they are making EVs affordable to people who ALREADY WANT an EV.  That should be blindingly obvious to anybody capable of doing math; a bribe of $15k to get you to spend $45k is not an incentive.

@donbruce8234 said a $15k incentive will raise prices of EVs by $15k--no it won't.  Again, they are discounting the whole market to get more people buying EVs because most EVs sold today are made by startups like Tesla and Rivian. Smaller companies do not have reserves of cash or the manufacturing capability that larger automakers have, which is why Tesla--now carrying around a decent war chest full of cash--is building factories all over the planet to make EV batteries and EVs (and battery banks, and solar panels, etc.).

1. It is still more expensive
2. Not enough charging stations for easy access.
3. It takes time to charge, which most people can't afford. It's not practical, time is money.
4. It's a false economy, as it doesn't reduce pollution because the electricity still has to be generated with fossil fuel.
5. It will only match the efficiency of the combustion cars if all (most) homes are equipped with electrical charging ports, where people can charge overnight. (It takes 1 to 3 nights to charge it on normal home socket).

As I sleep the car is being charged so that by morning the car is fully charged so there was never a need to use the chargers outside unless I go for a long trips.
That is when I probably will need to do a stop somewhere and charge for half an hour and I think that should be enough.
 I think probably if I drive from Penang to Singapore it probably takes 3 or 4 strategic kopi stops.

You have the choice to use EV all the time, but you have ICE when you really need it.
Less pollution from making smaller battery but less air pollution since most of the time people will use EV mode.
A lot of EV manufacturer is putting bigger battery because bigger battery will have longer lifetime and problem with charging infrastructure, so bigger batter will help a lot if you have less charging infrastructure.


Meanwhile, PHEV is better from overall environment standpoint.
You can always use EV mode if you want to save gasoline spending but you can always use ICE if you cannot find charging station or you are going out far.
The most complaint about EV car is they need to plan when and where they need to go since you cannot instantly charge your car and charging infrastructures are few and even fewer that can supercharge.

The biggest downside of PHEV though is the price since it has both ICE and EV components.
But I believe the big batter of EV itself can cost similar to ICE engines.
I feel like the combination of good EV motor with decent battery size plus weak ICE engine will sufficient for entry level car.

But arguing on the basis that the excise went into consolidated revenue is asinine. Everything goes into consolidated revenue. Even the very few things (usually at local level) that are flagged to be spent on a specific thing, actually go into consolidated revenue and are then equal spending comes from it. Fuel excise is in effect the same as a per km road user tax but one that applies a higher amount to less efficient vehicles. It makes ZERO sense to apply a road user tax to petrol/diesel vehicles as well, as moving the tax to that instead of excuse would reduce the incentive for electrification or higher efficiency. Pretending there could be both is in denial of reality, since no politician that suggested a new tax on all cars would survive until lunchtime. Eventually, there will be a road user tax on EVs, and eventually, it will have to replace all of the excise currently collected. 

Regardless of where the money goes, a loss in revenue for taxes somewhere needs to be replaced or spending cut.

Even if the charging networks provide all the chargers for free, who is going to pay for two other things which are *ALSO* essential - the increase in power required from our power stations, AND the uprating of the national grid to handle the vast increase in current consumption required, even if they only have to cover 20 million cars and trucks?
All very well a charging company providing a super fast charger at zero cost;  but do you think you can plug that into a 13 Amp socket?
More output from power stations is a big enough problem;  at least power stations are normally built as close to main population centres, so if the 132,000 Volt lines have to be enlarged or doubled up, they'll be pretty short.  But all that current has to be then stepped down by local sub-stations fitted with massive transformers.  You want more current going into a certain area?  Then you need more or larger transformers - and bear in mind, they're big enough that you need a *crane* to lift those transformers off the trucks that deliver them, so they aren't cheap.
Get power from windmills?  Sure - then the cabling problem gets even worse, because the windmills are not close to population centres, they're out in the middle of nowhere (or even out in the bloody North Sea!).
And who do think is going to pay for all the extra fitters you need to hire, as well as pay for the cable, sub-stations, power stations, and however many THOUSAND skilled fitters you need to upgrade the power networks in time for this supposed ""no IC vehicles sold after 2035""?
You want more?  NO problem.
Over 40% of all homes in Britain have NO secure off-road parking. If they aren't fortunate enough to have car parks provided by their employers WITH charging points, how and where are they suposed to get their EVs charged?
And a final shot across your bows;  the biggest supermarket in my nearest town has parking spaces for 235 cars.  Just TWO of them are equipped to charge EVs, and I've never seen any instance of 'charging point rage'.  Conclusion?

Is it fit for purpose ? No 

Are some Charging providers are they fit to run a network ? No 

I know they are private company’s & are in it to make a profit , But like Ev man said they get tax payer subsidies to build & install these chargers. 

So a question for you why do a lot of these companies now charge up to £0.85p per kw for 7kw AC charging ? 
And like Genie point £0.98p per kw for a 50kw charger

I would understand these high prices if they were 350kw chargers or even if they were 150kw chargers as they cost tens of thousands of pound to buy & install. 

It seems everyone nowadays has there hands out to cash in on the Ev surge. 
But I truly believe if things don’t change it will be the down fall of the Ev market.
The only thing propping it up at the moment is businesses , Because unlike the private buyer there are still grants available for there vehicles & charger installs & of course tax benefits for the business user / driver. But for everyone else there is nothing. 

With the rise in electric charging costs & the removal of government grants plus the rise in the cost of borrowing & with dealers saying they still need to be serviced & charging stupid a outs for this plus insurance rising for Ev’s & even road tax from 2025 & congestion charging from 2025 all the advantages have gone. 

It also doesn’t help when dealers don’t tell people the true range or cost of driving an Ev. 
It’s like say you buy an Etron 55 you will be lucky to average 2.5 miles per kw & that’s in the summer. 
Some Ev cost a lot more to run , My old i3 used to average over 5 miles per kw in the summer , so the Audi costs double to run than that. 

Can a private person save money owning an Ev the simple answer is No. 
And this is what everyone should know now you can’t save anything it will more likely cost you more to run over an ice car. People will probably jump on this & say they save money driving an Ev. 

And yes some people can , but only if they have solar already installed or they have access to free charging somewhere like work. Or if they are on a cheap night rate & they don’t use too much electric during the day because they pay more for the day time because of the cheap night rate , only to if they ever charge on that & they have a very efficient car & they drive it like an angel plus they got a good deal when they bought it & they paid cash , so no interest charge.

OK, BEVs are notorious for their lack of range and extended charge times (in comparison to petrol/diesel). An ICE, can be refuelled in just 5 minutes, whereas, the best time using a fast charge circuit is around 20 mins. That of course produces queues. Of course, the simple answer is more fast chargers.

But, this is where your investigation alas fails. As an example, assuming  a 150kw charger, it would require a 300 amp 3 phase circuit. That is a hefty cable, then multiply it by the number of chargers on a site. The mains supply circuit, is going to be massive, in your presentation you also conceived the idea of a 300kw charger.

You mention the ""grid"", not sure whether you mean the national grid, or the renewable grid i.e. wind turbines.

I'll assume you mean the latter. In which case, my response to that is, it will never happen. The hype at the moment is all about ""green"" renewable energy, particularly wind.

What you are not being told, is just how mammoth a task, that is. Since this government, and future governments, are legally tied to ""net-zero"", the plan is not realistic, either financially or infrastructure.

To replace our current power stations, will require the building of some 130,000 turbines, occupying about 13,000 sq miles of land, but that is just to replace our current electrical supply. If you then want to include transport, and of course transition to heat pumps. Then the network will have to be three times as large. Curiously, about 1/3rd would be to replace electric supply, another 1/3rd to replace gas (heating), and a final 1/3rd to convert transport to electric.

The cost of doing that will be in excess of £3Tn, that cost is not just for the wind farms, but a complete overhaul and reengineering of the national grid, which carries the power.

Apart from the phenomenal unaffordable cost, consider also, the sourcing of raw materials, to build the new infrastructure, the truth is that the materials would just not be available. Then add to that the maintenance, and the limited 20-year lifespan of the turbines.

You mention, that there was a company, that was willing to install the charging systems for free, well recall the  saying ""there's no such thing as a free lunch"". Somebody, somewhere ends up paying, and that would be in the charges for the electricity.

Hopefully, other readers of this posting, who may be very pro BEVs, may give this posting some serious consideration. If you still have doubts, please give some time to watching this post on the Tom Nelson channel, in an interview with Prof Michael Kelly, professor of Electrical & Electronic Engineering Cambridge Uni.

It's a movable unit with battery storage and 4 Kempower dispensers capable to share out 300kW of power load balanced. The 300kWh battery storage means it only needs at a minimum a 43kW grid connection. All packaged in a unit that is the same size as a 20feet container which means regulatory it is much easier to get approval to put down a ""temporary"" structure which is basically a container in your car park and hook up a relatively small grid connection to it. Not sure if the approval process is as easy in the UK for ""temporary"" chargers. As long as you have the right to use the land they can sit there for basically as long as you want to, its a container after all, but they can also be removed in a matter of hours and transported somewhere else should you wish.

The worse so far and they must have good reason for the delay, but Gridserve gained permission to install one of their large charging rest areas in Uckfield, E Sussex, this would also include a solar farm to help power it looking at the plans.

Councils move very slowly so nearly all our projects are private ones as we can get a fast charger installed in a few months free where some of our council projects have been 2 years and still not moved to installation!
Your last point about out of service is spot on. Many projects are badly managed and SLA for fixing is sometimes not even considered and in some cased may not even have an SLA and that is sooooo bad for everyone. Bad realtime data is also another big issue. I could go on and on. It will get better but at the moment the focus is on the land grab to get as many chargers in place that the running of them is not always considered.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:54.092737,0.0

The people in govt live in a pencil pushing world, they don't know how to actually do any of this, Id bet many may not understand the nuts and bolts of it, they just expect it to be done.

I hate to get political but look how long it took them to sort out Brexit, that was negotiations and the signing of documents, that was nothing close to the purchasing of land, plus the  paperwork and physical work installing thousands of chargers around the UK.

We are trying to get everyone trained on installing and servicing thousands of chargers, yet we cant keep the ones running that are already are installed, so ask yourself whats the chances it will get done in the 7 years we have left, I truly have my doubts.   

What blows me away is this, these chargers are not even close to old, but already they don't work, so how reliable will they be down the road, is this how the system, will be from here on out? will there always be lots of broken machines?  I was under the impression they were expected to last ten years or more, I was told they should be quite simple as they are all basically the same thing, a charger and a credit card machine, how difficult can it be.

Lets not forget we have a limited amount of trained electricians in the UK, they already have enough work taking care of normal business, now they are expected to install the charging system for the UK and all the personal ones at homes so that we can have a proper EV network.

I think the Govt is overstepping with promises they cant keep, but as you said with the local council its business as usual.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:54.092805,0.0

Bodies such as Ofwat or Ofsted are there to enforce safety and compliance but are not there to improve efficiency.

Local councils are run on the cheap (by necessity - no-one wants to pay lots of money to have highly skilled technocrats running them).  They are incapable of moving fast (they were not designed as rapid response units).  If you try and rush them beyond what they are capable;e of doing the likelihood is they will have to take short cuts that will lead to lots of mistakes being made.

Joined up thinking and quick judgement calls takes lots of experience, experience gained by many years of making mistakes and learning not to make the same mistake twice.  Elected officials don't stay in office long enough to gain that experience, and when they get elected out of office after their first mistake is discovered they don't get the chance to learn from that experience but are replaced by someone who has not yet made their first mistake.

Of course, probably the best people to put in charge of such a project at a national level should be someone with lots of experience in running the current ICE fuel infrastructure, but doing that would be politically unacceptable, so best just put in charge people who have no history in installing infrastructure because they are politically untainted by history.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:54.498901,0.0

I can't really work out how we are going to improve matters but we haven't much time to work it out.
One thought I have had is whether a start would be to demand that all Local Authorities produce a statement by, say,  the end of 2024 indicating how many charging points they will require in their area within the next 5 years and 10 years? They should be able to estimate the number of vehicles based in their area, entering their area each day and what that will mean for charging capacity requirements. They will also be able to anticipate how many residents will have the ability to charge directly at home and how many live in less suitable properties . Local authorities like North Yorkshire or North Norfolk would also be encouraged to think about the impact on their economy if touring holidays were no longer possible as a result of lack of charging facilities.
Whilst such statements wouldn't address the core issue they would give a nation wide perspective on the extent of the problem and might lead to Government realising that action needs to be taken to achieve the capacity indicated by the statements. I realise that there are already statements of the "" we need 300,000 chargers by 2030 "" but these are so general as to be meaningless. I feel that a figure per Local Authority might demonstrate the scale of the problem more.
Of course, even this basic step isn't going to happen without a push. Perhaps a Parliamentary Petition requesting such statements should be produced should be initiated? 100,000 signatures and you get a debate and perhaps you would get cross party support for getting LAs to do something??? In the meantime Freedom of Information Act requests to Local Authorities to ask if they have on going work to establish the charging capacity they will need in 2030 might produce some interesting responses?

I know the level 1&2 ones are just few thousand apiece at most, and any mall that installs those would already be drawing far more power than a few chargers would add, but there is no way most companies would be able to upgrade their transport vehicles to electric if at the same time they need to pay for multiple megachargers for the electric semis, the high voltage power lines needed for all of them to be able to get power at the same time, and possibly also the new power plant/energy storage needed to cover the power drain that cannot be spread across the day or use night time electricity because the trucks always arrive at 5AM and need to be loaded and ready to leave by 7AM every day.

The vehicles may be provided by subcontractors and the power company will cover the infrastructure investment cost by making long term contracts to insure reliable payments, but the companies still need to install their own chargers because they cannot risk a line at a public charger causing delays in their schedules.

You can provide as many chargers as you want, but without the cables to power them, they are useless.

In terms of chargers we have no rapid chargers but only fast ones (7kW) which 1 is based near 1 train station and 4 at the other train station and 1 by the leisure centre, yet there are 2 filling stations with at least 8 fuel pump units (unleaded, diesel and super unleaded in one unit).

The biggest barriers in just my opinion are listed below 

1. Price of Ev,s 
Most ev will cots you a min of £10,000 more than there petrol versions & in some cases even as much as £30,000 more , then add in the extra interest  you pay on just that extra cost & most people will be paying at least £15,000 more just to drive an Ev. 

NOTE Ev.s at the moment are losing there value on par or just a little worst than petrol cars 

2. Price of electricity 
As we all know electric has sky rocketed , Yes you can get cheap night rate charging for 4 or 6 hours but you then have to pay more for your electric during the other 18 to 20 hours of that day. Plus something most people don't realise is that you lose so many kw during the transfer & charge process eg lets say you have a 100 kw usable battery & it was on 0% ,  if you put in 100kw of electric it would only take that battery to around 85% charge & the rest would be lost in the transfer / charge process but you will pay for the whole 100 kw , same when you rapid charge. 

NOTE You can still save money owning an Ev if its a company car or you get free charging from somewhere. But unless you do around 15,000 a year & you can charge it for free , you will never recoupe just the extra you paid in interest on the finance / pcp. 

3. Cost overall 
    a. Dealers charging for a yearly service , when it isn't needed & voiding your Warrenty if you don't have it serviced / inspected 
    b. Insurence why are electric cars so expensive to insure over there petrol versions , they get stolen less , they have less accidents. 
    c. Install charger costs , Why do electricians charge so much to install an ev charger as its just like wiring an external socket 3 wires , apart from the extra cost for the armoured cable. Its £50 to £100 to have an external socket fitted , So why do most ev installers charge £500 min to install a charger , the armoured cable only costs around £80 extra. 

NOTE All these little things add up 

4. New Ev owners 
My first ev had a realistic range of about 50 miles , you had to plan your routes & have at least two back up plans when doing any distance traveling. 
You had to drive it like an Ev , Thats the thing a lot of the new Ev owners don't know how to drive Ev.s or just don't care. 
For instance I helped a guy at Tesco the other day he had just arrived in the uk that morning at Heathrow & they gave him a Mercedes EQC as a rental car. He said when he left Heathrow it showed 246 miles of range & was 100% charged. He pulled up at Tesco in a panic on 0% & had only covered 123 miles from Heathrow airport. When I saw him he was on the phone to the rental car company saying there was a problem with the car. They informed him ev are not good on the motorway lol & there was nothing wrong with the car. I had to show him the app he needed , as the card reader wasn't working on the charger. 
You see most people don't want to drive slower or drive without the heater on or aircon , They want to jump into there Ev & drive it like a petrol car , But the trouble is if you do that you will kill the range & it will cost you a lot more to own. Also gone are the days of Ev owners only charging to 80% for the sake of other ev owners needing the charger & protecting the battery. 99% of people charge to 100% & don't care if there is a queue waiting. 

5. Personal opinion 

Car manufactures , Ev installers , insurance company , Charger companies all need to stop taking the Mickey 

Eg Make servicing an option , Lower the prices eg Mg why is the electric zs double the cost of its petrol twin or Mercedes EQC Why is the ev version £25,000 more than the ice twin. Ev installers installing a socket is exactly the same as installing an ev charger , you have to connect it to the consumer unit run a cable & mount & connect the socket , exactly the same for an Ev charger apart from the cable is armoured & thicker. So just charge extra for the parts & don't double / triple the fitting cost. Charger companies I know you need to male money & I know rapid chargers are expensive but not the 7kw or 22kw chargers so why charge anything from 44p per kw up to 69p per kw for a fast charger. Plus remember your costomers tax money subsidies you. Make money but stop being greedy with you ac charging prices. Insurence companies come on less get stolen & less get into accident stop charging stupid prices.I can insure a M4 Comp £120 cheaper than my I pace.

On their website it says one of their responsibilities is ""supporting charging infrastructure on the wider roads network"" (in addition to grants for home and workplace charge points).
It's not clear that they have the same regulatory teeth as Ofcom but they do seem to be the same sort of Government so maybe they could acquire teeth in that respect. 
Another thing I found when Googling is that on 30 March this year (ie just over 2 weeks ago) the Government announced £380 million (or £381 million, depending which press release you read...) to launch something called the ""Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure fund"" (LEVI Fund) which is supposedly about helping ""local authorities in England to work with the chargepoint industry"" which would seem to be *exactly* the sort of thing discussed in this video. The Energy Saving Trust seem to be closely involved in this.
Will it work? I'm no expert in these things so I don't know; I'm sure many others here will be better informed.
But is it a good time to engage with this new LEVI fund that's just been set up, maybe by engaging with your local authority or the Energy Saving Trust...? I'd suggest it might be an opportunity, for folks living in England at least.",none,,2023-12-02 21:32:54.808032,0.0

Ford is switching production workers from petrol F100 lines to EV right now. Any company who waits until 2035 is going bankrupt. Even 2030 is very late. If you think about it many people buy cars using leasing. the lease payments are based on the future value of the car. As sales of ICE cars drop the cost of fuel will go up and number of fuel stations reduce. Also future values drop and hence lease payments go up. A virtuous circle of increased costs to discourage ICE car sales at least three to five years before production stops. So the turning point could start at roughly three years time. It is already happening in China now with many thousands of top end ICE cars just not selling. So infrastructure needs to be built in the next three years or so.

EVs are disruptive technology and as demand for petrol and diesel declines petrol stations will close. They operate on very small margins so a drop in trade can easily make them unviable.

If anyone including the authorities, manufacturers truly want to “save” the planet from climate change, we would have now seen majority of our buses go electric & not just some taxis with hybrid engines.  Again viewing experiences of early EV adopters in the USA, EVs may have initial low maintenance until they are out of warranty or if you are unlucky to own a lemon - the cost and/or waiting time start to skyrocket - lack of parts & expertise.  To me, EVs are equivalent to mobile phones and the manufacturers are doing the same - only the manufacturers and/or their well paid “cronies” have exclusive access to resources to repair those EVs.

About me: I own Tata Nexon EV max lux XZ, I purchased it on 3rd of Feb 2023.

1. The talked range of 330 by owner ( which more of a looks like Tata Sales person) you will never achieve that. Maximum practical range that you should expect is around 250kms.

2. This car is too congested at the back seat, there is not even space for 2 people to sit comfortably let aside 3 people. Leg space is too little, battery position pushes the entire floor of the car a little more upwards, which further reduces the leg space.

3. This car lacks a state of art finishing, looks like more of a jugaad, you can see wires coming out of different places beneath the seat, near by to brakes,under the car. Also looking the car from outside doesn’t look like a industry grade finishing.

3. Subsidy that you get is totally arbitrary, from my personal experience it’s been more than 2.5 months for me, still have not received the subsidy. It is pending with Egrasy’s account officer for more than 2  months.

4. There is no myth of sunroof being small, it’s truth it’s placed at the very wrong position, neither the person sitting at the back or at front seat can easily manage to go out.

5. Never ever plan to take this car out, I went to Rishikesh there is no charging infra there, it takes at least 2 hours to fully charge it with fastest charger available in the market (as Tata throttles charging at 30KW/H doesn’t matter what is the chargers capacity.  Also, all fast charger providers are charging per unit @20-23rs/unit + 10% GST.

6. Slow chargers (3 and 7kw/H) will take around 13 and 6 hours to charge it fully, forget using these chargers when you are on a trip. Also, I live in a society where there is no charging infra, no support from societies for chargers installation my Society is asking for a deposit of 50k to enhance the load and will charge per unit at a commercial rate of 14rs/KW.

7. Tata support and service is worst, it took me 5 days to get a pick up schedule for my first service, and after that they delivered the car without wash. It needed me to raise this issue with Sheel(Tata Motors India Sales head) to solve this petty issue. 

Personally I am looking to sell this car and go with a hybrid one.",none,,2023-12-02 21:33:12.890502,3.0

Then one should know each gallon of gasoline is about 33.4 kWhrs of electricity equivalent.  One can also find in the States how many cars are on the road each day; how far they drive on average; what the average fuel efficiency is. Then with a little arithmetic one concludes to replace all those cars w/ EVs would require 42% of all the power we make!  We don’t have the electricity to run an EV society even if we were willing too. We need to build LOTS more power plants - LOTS.  And this calculation does not include all our truck traffic.   We are screwed.  Those power plant will likely - mostly - be natural gas plants.,none,,2023-12-02 21:33:35.839641,0.0

Germany is heavily reliant on natural gas from Russia, which accounts for 35% of its imports of the fuel.
Natural gas is a vital energy source for Germany, which accounts for about a quarter of the country’s total energy mix.
Russia has already cut gas flows to Germany by 60% since June 2021, citing an equipment hold-up in Canada as a result of sanctions over the war in Ukraine.
Germany fears that the situation may get worse after the scheduled shutdown of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for maintenance from July 11 to July 212. There is no guarantee that the gas flows will resume after that.
Entire industries in Germany, such as aluminum, glass, and chemical industry, are in danger of collapsing permanently because of the gas bottlenecks. These industries employ hundreds of thousands of people and contribute significantly to the country’s economy.
The gas shortage is also driving inflation to record highs, which threatens social stability and consumer spending.
Germany has moved into the second stage of its three-stage emergency gas plan, which involves securing alternative supplies and energy sources, easing infrastructure bottlenecks, encouraging energy savings, and expanding solidarity agreements to share gas across countries1. However, these measures may not be enough to cope with a total shutoff of Russian gas.
A total shutoff of Russian gas could lead to shortages of 15% to 40% of annual consumption in some countries in Central and Eastern Europe, which are also dependent on Russian gas. This could have spillover effects on Germany’s trade, investment, and financial links with these countries.
A total shutoff of Russian gas could also reduce Germany’s gross domestic product by up to 6%, according to some estimates3. This would be a severe setback for the country’s economic recovery from the pandemic.",none,,2023-12-02 21:33:56.245933,0.0

China sees the Ukraine war an opportunity to make the West's manufacturers shut their doors, close their plants and depend completely on China. They're also going to use it to try and shift to more complex and high end manufacturing usig cheap fuel from Russia... Basically what Germany did, except Russia will either be literally divided or military defeated. Therefore China won't have to worry like Germany should have.

For another key component of batteries - lithium - China is also in the Top 3 of producing countries (if you count the lithium triangle in Chile/Argentina/Bolivia as one). Australia being the other one in the Top 3. There are massive concerns around the environment and indigenous rights around the South American lithium production. So you can’t easily get around China here as well. He already talked about Chinas dominance for gold. AND - as he rightfully pointed out - China owns most of the refineries for all of these minerals.

Why?

Because we made a big economic mistake on closing our European economies to Russia, after we haven’t yet recovered from covid.

This generated stagflation, a big inflation.

This mistake, is being used by China to increase their car sales to Russia, where they sell cars like hot cakes.

The CCD has certainly been tremendously successful! I think the most important thing is that it's reduced the total future emissions liability, that is the future emissions that we lock in by the vehicles we buy, assuming each vehicle lasts a certain number of km, by more than 30%! I think that needs to be talked about, because more important than increasing the number of electric vehicles, is reducing the number of ICE vehicles. 

I noted a couple of errors in James' comments though. One is that electric vehicles (meaning those with a plug) are only running at about 12% of overall registrations, and roughly 20% of brand new passenger cars. Certainly not one in two. And I believe that National's original plan was for the RUC exemption to end when EVs reached 2% of the light passenger vehicle fleet. We're past 2.3% as of August, so more than there. But I do think that introducing RUC at $76 per 1000 km would be stupid, since it's double what some petrol cars pay.

From Cox Automotive:

""Electric vehicle (EV) sales volumes set another record in Q3, as total sales of battery-powered vehicles jumped past 300,000 for the first time in the U.S. market. Year-to-date EV sales through September reached just over 873,000, putting the market firmly on track to surpass 1 million for the first time ever. The milestone will likely be achieved in November.

Total EV sales in Q3, according to an estimate from Kelley Blue Book, hit 313,086, a 49.8% increase from the same period one year ago and an increase from the 298,039 sold in Q2.""


Yes, there are some dealerships where EV inventory is stacking up.  But, there are also dealerships where ICE vehicle inventory is stacking up.

It's more of a trendy thing amongst people who don't have any wisdom & see technological advancement as a neat innocent thing. The Government also subsidizes the EV market here & it still hasn't caused it to gain popularity. The REAL PROBLEM here is the way the Government & Market try to force EVs & anything so called ""Green"". Here we have Leftist & Government promoting ESG (Environmental, Social, & Governance) which mixes Political Issues with Market Investing. There's a lot Leftist Run fund managing companies that are investing peoples savings into ESG causes without the investors knowledge. I've also heard about Banks promoting ESG by using it as a measuring stick for personal loans approval for private investment. 

This is off the topic but the US Government also have funding set up for nonwhites exclusievly which is insane & another Leftist agenda. 

EVs promotion is part of the false C02 causes Climate Change Movement. There are huge pushes for Wind & Solar which aren't a viable alternative to Oil & Natural Gas. A good alternative source for stationary Electricity use is Nuclear Power & we do have Nuclear Power Plants in the US but it all depends on the State & its hard to overcome the decades of Nuclear fear mongering. Also another major issue with EVs in America is in the Rust Belt where roads are treated with salt because of snow & ice & Rust is a notorious issue that greatly reduces the lifespan of Vehicles. There's some treatments that can slightly increase the life but it's so bad that the average lifespan for a vehicle is 10-15 years. There's several Rust Belt Mechanics that do content on YouTube that you can watch to see just how bad it is. An Evs lifespan in the rust belt would be even worse & possibly dangerous if the rust affected the stability of the battery. Also the kicker is a lot of the population of America live in the Rust Belt.

Anyway I'm glad your staying on the issue with EVs because its a very important part of a bigger agenda & its driving combustion engine car prices up because manufactures are being subsidised to build more EVs with any consumer demand. THe false C02 Emissions' is Causing a Climate Catastrophe is a huge problem that emcompasses so many issues.",none,,2023-12-02 21:33:59.625604,0.0

I live in the UK and for the second winter running, the government have introduced (a quite feeble) incentive for consumers to cut back on their domestic electricity consumption at peak times.  They do this with a series of target periods, trying to fool us by making it sound like a game to win prizes.  Today we are all being asked to cut back between 5:30PM and 6:30PM.

Of course they blame Ukraine, Gaza, unicorn infestations, everything but the honest truth.

Firstly, it is winter, it is getting colder, electricity consumption increases - nothing is going to change that.

But the two unspokens are immigration and EV charging.  

This year the nett migration into the UK increased the population by 1%.  That means without doing anything, the electricity grid needs to supply an additional 1% of energy.  And that is going to increase at that rate year on year until something breaks.

And there are more EVs about, not as many as the government would like, but definitely more.  My household is a heavier than average electricity consumer.  Heating and hot water is gas-powered, which is pretty common in the UK, although the crazy government wants to end that too.  But I mostly work from home, so in all day, I work in IT so am running at least three computers all the time, I use the large screen TV a lot, my son and my wife have computers too, and cooking is all electric. And that amounts to about 70kWh per week.  Now to fully charge a typical EV from empty also takes about 70kWh.  So charging an EV just once per week is the equivalent to the needs of an above-average house.  Estimates say that there are 28 million houses and 1 million EVs in the UK.  So just charging each EV once per week is equivalent to a 3.6% increase in the number of households demanding electricity.

At the moment it is just non-compulsory games, but you can see where it is going, it is clear that there are very real concerns that the electricity grid cannot handle peak loads - today it is non-compulsory games, tomorrow it is likely to be mandatory rationing.",none,,2023-12-02 21:33:59.626129,2.0

But there is so many issues with EVs, the first major issue is manufactures still have this lock out mentality for repairs, if governments want to get serious about this issue they need to stop their corrupt actions always sideing with big companies over their constitutes. 
Tesla is the worst offender trying to have all repairs in house.
I find it funny how manufactures try and lock mechanics out but do they offer collision repairs at the dealer?
If companies make cars that are hard to fix how are you going to get serviced on a road trip, not that many people would road trip with an EV.

Second big issue is battery tech, I'm sure one day we will have a battery that won't kill you if it decides it wants to transition from a power pack into a flaming fire hazzard spilling poisonous gas out all over the place.
Then there is battery life, compatibility, recycling and minerals.
If you don't have a cheap option for repair with a declining battery your EV is basically a write off and sell it at the local auction house to the cock roaches that wreck cars. 
That sort of feeds back into the first issue.

The third issue is insurance, this also feeds back into both the previous issues.
If a battery is built so it's hard to replace and or service at a collision repair workshop the repaier is likely to write it off.
I switched employment about 9 months ago, but my last job we did collision repair work and we had done two battery packs last year, both with case damage from driving over rocks or something like that, one had actually shifted the pillow cells inside.
Then you have this numpty on the radio here in Australia claiming that battery packs are ruggered and insurance companies will let small damage go......... he's completely wrong and there's no way I would let a EV out of my workshop with case damage.
I refuse to work on EVs now because I value my skin not melting off my legs and my lungs operating properly.

Any car review experts will tell you an Outlander advertised 1.9L/100k is not achievable under ‘real world conditions’, they actually got 6.7L/100km, not much less than a smaller Kia Cerato.
Other points include:
You’d be lucky to get 40km EV mode on a full charge <2019 models.
Can’t run without ICU when heater on, Victoria is a cold state so I’m driving on fuel at least 6 months of the yr
Can’t run on EV mode on the freeway, ICU kicks in after a certain speed
Running on ICE drinks more as it’s lugging an additional 350kg of EV battery and motors
People pay more to go green, even though they’ll be lucky to get 10yrs on the EV battery before paying approx 8k (today’s average) for a replacement. That’s about the price of petrol you’d pay over 10yrs (based on today’s fuel prices), but people still choose to go green to reduce their carbon footprint 

Now, what is this ‘road user’ charge exactly when we’re already paying rego for that?
Even after the points on a PHEV, they argue PHEV owners should compensate for the 42.5 fuel excise ‘they’re falsely claim’ these people are avoiding? 
Is it fair for a person who owns an acre of land to pay this tax (supposedly covering road using) when they use it for their ride-on to mow the grass on their land, not govt roads?""

This road user ‘charge’ has no reasoning other than their mismanagement of tax payer funds and overspending us into the debt we’re now in, especially through their management of the lockdowns that they now unfairly charge minority groups to compensate for their errors incl. Commonwealth Games
People genuinely want to reduce their carbon footprint and pay the extra upfront, even though the lifespan of EV and cost of a replacement battery, servicing adds up to be more than a conventional ICE car, but the gov don’t care as long as they’re getting their fuel excise.

First they aren't as eco-friendly as ICE vehicles considering the amount of heavy metals and minerals that need to be extracted for batteries, the energy required to create the cells, the inefficient charging converting AC voltage to DC voltage to charge these things and let's not forget that aside from Tasmania most of that energy is coming from dirty energy sources like coal anyway. It would be one thing if Australia had renewable energy like hydroelectric or nuclear but in this environment where it's seen as politically incorrect to support energy production that isn't home grown like coal I don't see that happening. Second EVs due put wear and tear on our roads and considering toll roads make up a handful of total mileage in Australia the cost to maintain such roads lies squarely on the government.  Third Australia lacks the infrastructure to charge EVs. And I know this is gonna trigger you EV people but please visit Canada or the US driving a Tesla before you jump to conclusions.

My understanding was that the Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit is a non refundable credit. 

A non refundable credit can reduce your tax liability to 0 (zero), however it cannot result in a refund. What this means is if you qualify for a $350 credit and your tax liability is $200, you will only receive a $200 credit on your return. If your tax liability is zero you would not receive the credit at all, even though you are otherwise eligible for it.

As of 10 Jun 2023, the electric vehicle tax credit is nonrefundable, meaning taxpayers who purchase qualifying electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid vehicles can lower their tax liability by the corresponding credit amount. The credit can make a sizable dent in the tax bill, but it won't result in a refund beyond that.  I would recheck your source.",none,,2023-12-02 21:34:10.274198,1.0

-- An Invention We Cannot Live Without!
(I hope someone from Senator Cornyn's office will read this carefully and pass it along to him. I've been studying this subject since 2005, and I know whereof I speak.) 

The internal combustion engine is one of the most important inventions upon which our entire civilization depends. And, there is no comparison between an internal combustion engine and any electrically powered vehicle. There are numerous things an 'IC-Engine can do which EV's will never be able to do. First and foremost, the driver of an IC-Engine can dramatically increase the power (torque) of the engine simply by foot-pressure on the gas-pedal. Ask any working farmer with an IC Pickup Truck how important that is. Another difference? If you run out of gas in an IC-Engine, all you need is a hand-held auxiliary gas-can you can dump into the vehicle. Imagine having to put a spare-tank of EV batteries in the back of your truck? If you consider the tanks our military uses, there is no way we'll ever be able to make a practical and capable tank based on batteries. The only way to power this enormously heavy vehicles is using an IC-Engine -- up to and including in some cases, actual rocket engines. (Yes Virginia, Rockets are 'internal combustion engines too!).  


That said: we are facing a climate crisis which could decimate human civilization if we continue to convert our fossil fuel deposits into atmospheric CO2. Need I repeat that? If we keep going as we are, it will be catastrophic for human civilization. 

More to the point, the fossil fuels we currently use in or IC-engines are running out. Those fuels took 500-million years to accumulate. Yet, we have burned through (arguably) 50% of our fossil fuels in just 200 years. Think about that!?! How could we continue binging on fossil-fuels and not change the climate!


What is the solution? Its not switching to EVs! The solution is obvious: we need to produce Carbon-Neutral Hi-energy equivalents to Kerosene and Gasoline. And our Oil companies know this! 
Not only do they know it, they're the companies in the best position to establish a new industry producing Carbon-Neutral Liquid Fuels (CNLF), cultivated in the planet's oceans.  

How do you cost-effectively produce CNLF? Thanks to Jimmy Carter, we know how to do it. Carter funded the ""Aquatic Species Research Program"" in 1978. and over a period of about 10 years, scientists developed prototypes of so-called 'Bio-Reactors' capable of cultivating 'Algal' to produce high-energy liquid fuels on a sustainable basis. The problem with bio-reactors? They were designed to be built in our country's desert SW regions, requiring cost-prohibitive plumbing and maintenance.What's the common-sense solution? Create vast arrays of Deep-Ocean Algal (algae) based cultivation networks in the planet's deep oceans, particularly those with naturally occurring beneficial sea-water nutrients (aka: HNLC zones), such as those off the west-coast of South America. 

Algae happens to be the single largest bio-mass on Earth. Its the foundation of the entire Ocean Food Chain. Algae takes the energy of the sun and CO2 out of the water in which it lives, and converts it into hydrocarbons. Thats exactly how our fossil-fuels were created! Furthermore, by establishing Deep Ocean Aquaculture of this kind, we will be able to reinforce and rebuild our ocean fisheries.

This isn't just a good-idea, its an absolutely essential step that we, as a species, must take in order to establish sustainable and portable energy resources for mankind going forward from the here and now. If we don't do it (and assuming our continued reliance on fossil-fuels), we will render catastrophic damage to our existing biosphere. One need look no further than the annual snow-melt in the Arctic (particularly the thousands of gigatons of fresh water dumped into the Atlantic Ocean by Greenland each year), to recognize the threat that poses to densely populated sea-level zones around the world. Not just Bangladesh, and countries in the vicinity of India, but places like New Orleans, Miami Beach, Chesapeake Bay, and New York City, all of which are already under siege by rising sea-levels (a few inches every year).

Yes, there are already many experimental projects in progress attempting to cultivate algae as a source of sustainable liquid fuels. Unfortunately, in almost every case, the scale of the methodology is insufficient to the task at hand: producing carbon-neutral high-energy liquid fuels at a cost per barrel equal to or less than what we're spending on fossil-liquid-fuels. Not saying its going to be easy to do, but compared to some of the other great things we've accomplished to-date (as a species), I'm suggesting that if we focus on this goal, we can find a way to achieve it. And one more thing? If we don't, the doomsayers who have been flogging the Solar-Panels & Windmills 'solution' may well succeed in sending humankind to an early grave in this century.",none,,2023-12-02 21:34:38.333572,0.0

What you will never be told is that EVs waste MORE oil & natural gas than gasoline engines do...  If people were educated, they'd know that electricity to power lighting and heating/air conditioning is about to become way more expensive for the average home, because of the EV demand the corrupt politicians are trying to create.
Its just a means of transferring massive amounts of cash from the slush fund we call the IRS, to politically connected individuals.  The EV concept itself is a fraud... not just because of the huge oil usage in their manufacture, and dirty battery construction, those are a disgusting waste, but people are so dumb that NOBODY seems to know that when an EV is plugged into the power outlet, it's using oil & natural gas that is burned in electrical generation plants.  And that the energy loss (energy conversion loss) that occurs when oil or gas is burned to heat the boilers that then spin the turbines to create the electricity... is a loss of 66% of the energy that's burned, giving you a 34% output of energy in the form of electrical energy, which then goes into the national electrical grid... where an additional 10% of THAT energy (in the form of electricity) is lost from the grid via electron migration, because it just leaks out into the air at a steady rate.  SO, now you have a net loss of the energy from the petroleum inputs totaling 66% plus 10% of the captured electricity (.10X.34=3.5%), for a total loss of 69.5% of the energy that was contained in the oil or natural gas.  Then too, the battery of the EV also leaks electricity via electron migration (especially in cold weather) losing another five percent of the electrical energy.  It means that anyone who is pro-conservation, and wants to see petroleum products used efficiently, cannot justify the EV industry on any level, because making electricity and holding it in a battery wastes so much of the oil energy inputs.  It's a bad joke calling it 'Green'.  But corrupt politicians know the people are dumb, and they can take your tax money.  We call that a scam where I'm from (Boston).  AS far as GASOLINE powered combustion engines go... first, a gallon of gasoline is a distilled fractionate of oil that represents only a portion of each barrel of crude oil, other fractionated petroleum products are produced during the same oil distilling process.  And the energy 'conversion loss' of burning gasoline in a car motor is through heat, as the motor puts out heat from the combustion cycle.  Overall, a typical gasoline engine is a more efficient use of petroleum energy.",none,,2023-12-02 21:34:45.523794,0.0

Let us export Scrap machinery and scrap metal abroad. Your so called Environment agency ruining our small business and wants to see what happens with scrap machinery abroad. They should be concerned about the facility here not abroad because we have our own Environment agency there. 

They returned our shipment from Uk port back to our site and our container had only scrap metal no cars, no battery , no plastic , no uk household rubbish its just metal which we have paid for to. Recycling Centre here and vat is paid too and we pay all the taxes. If your environment agency people carry on like this we might have to close our small business because of their actions we have been charged £5000 for the return of our container from one of your port in the Uk.

Get a grip over your Environment agency rather than ruining the small businesses which are still running and paying there workers their wages. I have no other way to contact you rather than Social media or maybe write a letter to you soon to make you aware of this because we end up going bankrupt. 

All the workers we have will lose their jobs unfortunately.

It's understandable that the Prime Minister may be struggling to address all of these issues at once.

However, there have been some concerns about the Prime Minister's approach to certain issues, as well as his tendency to make false statementsTax cuts for the wealthy: These tax cuts have widened the wealth gap in the UK, making it harder for the poor and middle class to get ahead. This has led to a decline in living standards for many people, and has made the UK a less attractive place to live and work.
Cuts to social programs: These cuts have made it harder for people to access essential services such as healthcare, education, and social care. This has led to a decline in the quality of life in the UK, and has made it more difficult for people to reach their full potential.
Deregulation of the financial industry: This deregulation has led to increased financial instability, and has made the UK economy more vulnerable to shocks. This has made it more difficult for businesses to invest and for people to plan for their futures.
Leaving the European Union: This has created barriers to trade and investment, and has made it more difficult for UK businesses to compete in the global market. This has led to a decline in economic growth, and has made the UK a less attractive place to do business.
In addition to these economic impacts, the Prime Minister's policies are also making the UK a less welcoming and inclusive place to live. His rhetoric has emboldened racists and xenophobes, and has made it more difficult for minorities to feel safe and accepted. This has damaged the UK's reputation on the world stage, and has made it less attractive to immigrants and tourists.",none,,2023-12-02 21:34:52.254982,6.0

They further warned that we only had 10 years to save the planet from catastrophe. If we did not heed this warning and act upon it, the ice caps would melt, the oceans would rise and whole islands and coastal towns would disappear under the waves. Temperatures would rise exponentially causing global warming and millions of people would die of thirst and hunger as whole countries would be turned into virtual deserts.

1. Person A makes 100k a year. The tax LIABILITY is 24% or 24K. Person A contributed 25k to federal taxes throughout the year in form of paycheck tax deductions. Person A will received a refund of 1k (25k contributed - 24k federal tax liability). 
Now let us say person A bough a Tesla Model 3. This will drop person A's tax liability by 7.5k. Person A federal tax liability is now 16.5k. Person A still contributed 25k in from of paycheck tax deduction so his refund at the end of the year is 8.5k.

2. Person B makes 100k a year but is somehow able to write most of the income off. Let us say they can write off 80k of their income. Person B taxable income is now only 20k. The federal tax liability is 12% or 2.4k. The ev tax credit will drop that liability to 0, but person B will not receive the remainder of the tax credit(non-refundable part).

3. Person C is also making 100K a year with a tax liability of 24k. This person for some reason only contributed 22k to federal tax in form of paycheck tax deductions.  Person C now owes 2k in taxes. 
Person C now buys a Tesla Model 3. Person C tax liability reduces by 7.5k, so person C now has a tax liability of only 16.5k. Person C will now get a refund of 5.5k

Really appreciate it. I could fine all historical development. Thanks.  However, I am wondering if you could do similar detailed analysis on i) pricing policy of EV traders and including margin. (As such Nepal is a country where government allows same margin (profit) for perishable goods like fish and vegetable and EV and other non-perishable commodity. I think this happens only in Nepal). How could/should government intervene in this issue (being a trader yourself will it be inconvenient for you to delve on this matter?), ii) Next issue is why should EV sellers be expected (by commoner) to build and operate charging station. Also why shouldn't private sector be encouraged to build and operate it similar to fossil fuel stations. Including, of course, a question should NEA build and operate charging station. Can they ensure reliable services (Their staff gets paid salary at end of the month without regard of the fact whether charging station operate for a day or thirty).

In my case infortunately, I had booked Ola S1 Air way back on October 2022. I  was planning to wait for 6-7 months as pricings were supposed to go up after 1 June.

But my current scooter Mahindra Rodeo is giving issues every month and breaking down any where on road. I am getting no support for it from Company. Most of the times parts are unavailable. Most mechanics decline to service the Mahindra scooter. So I have to buy a new scooter now.

As such my daily running is not much (4km per day). So comsidered a petrol scooter like Yamaha Fascino for some time. Just because it is said to give a very good fuel efficiency (55-60kmpl in real world. There are also instances where people got 100kmpl+ in standard driving conditions under guidance of showroom/company. Videos are available on YouTube).

But I really want to shift to electric. So I went ahead and booked Ola S1 Air. 

It costed me 1,14,500 in Pune without insurance, without extended guarantee, without Ola Care Plus.

I will have to shell out another 4500₹ for insurance (Acko Insurance) before taking delivery. Its still cheaper by 1000₹ than insurance which Ola is providing (5,500₹, Acko Insurance).

I hope I am taking correct decision by buying Ola S1 Air. Fingers crossed.",none,,2023-12-02 21:35:32.998583,1.0

The items skip import taxes, do not pay fair shipping cost and safety standards that are required when Chinese good are sold in the USA or Western stores are skipped.  Tumu ( not sure if I qm spelling correctly)? is a perfect example. I have a friend who bought a coffee maker for Tumu  and she almost lost her dog and camper when the coffee maker  just started a fire. She had stepped out her camper and the coffee maker was plugged in for like 3 minutes. Her dog went nuts and she was able to get the fire out. She was lucky her dog made her aware or she was not on a hike or something. When she went to have her camper check to ensure there was no electrical issues none were found. It is just not worth saving $10.00 to buy there crap. I will be so glad when I stop seeing everything made in China. I have gotten item from Vietnam and other countries and they are made so much better. China had a lot of new wealth, support  a throw away society that was lead to believe it growth will never end. Well growth also get to a limit no matter what the business is. The Chinese would rather make thing that break,  to keep jobs,  then understand the cost, energy, waste and the horrible effect on there environment by there waste. Like why make people work 72 hours a week. While we fight a lot in the USA, but that what actually keeps this country going. The new ideas and the freedom to try them out, even if the idea sucks. In China individual thought is basically squashed and not excepted. Which is why China can only copy and manufacturer good instead of coming up with new technologies. Basically the only computer chips China can make are low grade ones.The other have to be imported so they can put them in.  China had to  to import the ball point part of the pen  to make the pens  because they could not fiqure out how to do it themselves until about 5 years ago.  Well the USA came up with the ball point pen in the late 1800's. Their high speed trains they copied from Japan. China cannot do anything without stealing someone ideas. Then the corruption mean no matter what you buy the product you buy that does no goes thought the west safety standards will probably be inferior. Which is why you have concrete building falling apart in China all the time even though they are just a few years old.. But with new money a lot of Chinese people bought cars, but did not understand that you need to maintain them, like changing out the oil. But fires from the electric cars and bikes is a everyday event in China. When something happens in China they cover it up or talk about how great the government responded. Like when  10 government people showed up when a town of 1000's die due to some horrible event.  Even the propaganda coming out of Turkey after that Earthquake was insane. There would be a group of international workers trying to get people out and you would have one Chinese man basically photo bombing the picture say how great China was helping and Whining about how the USA was not . Well when we send people many time it is combination of government and and non-profit and there jobs is not bragging to the world about doing the right thing.  The worse part is when the CCP put this propaganda on our free social media and American thing our country does nothing when that is just not true. The USA is the largest provider of free food to improvised countries in the world. We also the largest country that have non-profit that help in international proverty. China does not help with anything unless they want something in return ( like access to put a military bases on your coast line. 
Meanwhile China emission is worse then all the western industrial countries combines and now they have massive water shortage that basically decreases there ability to us hydropower.  They are going back to coal that will make the problem worse. I feel sorry for the two Koreas because they get the worse of the toxic air pollution  from China and then the rest blows into Japan. China green energy is about show and not about it doing what the purpose is. China has the worse air, land and water pollution in the world. India is not that far behind and India infrastructure is very old. I do not think they can take China place. In fact no country should take over world manufacturing like China did again. It is not good for any country to be so dependent on another. 80% of the surface water in China is too toxic to any human use and 50% under ground water is ruined also. 70% of China food in imported. In the USA 15% of food is important  and is more about providing variety then actual need. China is in a huge world of hurt and the more they get demanding and pushy the more the chinese people will suffer as the rest of the world moves on and see China fail.",none,,2023-12-02 21:35:39.977126,0.0

Here's the scam - 
Car company also 'invests-in' or establishes its own EV 'sister lease company', etc. - that they 'sell' the car to (really just selling it to themselves - right pocket - left pocket)
For every vehicle, the government pays a large subsidy, and there are also numerous tax breaks/incentives involved
There are some requirements that they must 'get-around' - They must register, license the cars, and have up-to-date inspection stickers - for a minimum of I think, 2 years or so - then they can 'cash-in'.
It is all a huge scam, and as I said makes China look good - that they are producing and selling a lot of EV vehicles - 'so-called' touting their image as leading the world in EV etc.

Don't try to win this game. It doesn't matter what you do, you will never win and here is why:

#1) if you buy a house, you better pay cash for it, because if you get into a mortgage, the mortgage industry with the help of the federal government will eat you alive. The feds increasing the rates, the mortgage companies charging even higher interests, plus requiring you to have unnecessary home insurance policies.
#2) if you buy a house, you better buy it in the middle of the woods, because if you buy it in a populated urban city, the government will eat you alive again by charging you a ton of money in taxes.. Money that its going to be wasted in a bunch of unnecessary garbage that will probably be used against you in the future.. More inspectors to make your life unpleasant during stupid inspections, unnecessary government positions and or government properties, plus bribery and money under the table. Your taxpayer money is often passed around like it doesn't cost them anything, well, in reality it doesn't cost them anything. If you don't pay, you could even go to jail for it.
#3) if you buy a house, it better not have an HOA. Otherwise you will fall prey of some bad, non-government people who will have probably as close as much power over your property than you. They can even put a lien on it and force you to sale it due to premium default. No bueno!

and #4... if you don't buy a house and decide to rent,... even worse.. you'll be paying everything I mentioned earlier  plus a profit for the owner.

Also, if you have solar panels don't attach them to the grid. Keep a separate system. Learn how to maintain it. Etc. It'll save you a TON of money and headache in the long run. :)

I would say at least 80% of Americans are under insured. Even if your homeowner policy is a replacement cost policy, there are certain items inside the house that are not covered or are limited. A lot of insurance companies won't cover solar panels unless they're scheduled to your policy and in some cases they require an inspection to make sure that they're done properly. Items like jewelry, guns and electronics are limited on policies so most only cover about $500 total. And if you have more than that on your policy, you're going to want to schedule whatever it is to the policy or they're not going to cover it if you have a theft or disaster. 

Car insurance is the same way. Most Americans don't have enough liability on their insurance policy to cover them in case of an accident. If you take the basic coverage for your state and you have an accident You could be on the hook for thousands of dollars. As an example where I live in Illinois, the minimum coverage is $25,000 per person or $50,000 total per accident for injuries and death. Property damage is only $20,000 for that same accident. Ask yourself how much do you think someone's going to sue you for If they're injured in an accident that was your fault and do you think their vehicle damage will be more than $20,000 If it is, you don't have enough insurance.

Answer:  It's all about Underwriting risks Vs. rewards (premium received).
Think about it.  An insurance company, like any business can only stay open, if it can make a profit.
How much they charge is based on 'risks' at the time the policy is issued.
If you change (especially, increase) the risk, then the insurer should either collect more premium or reassess whether or not 'the risk' is worth it to them.  Hence, canceling policies.

While solar panels may reduce the electrical bill for the homeowner, it does the opposite for an insurer.
It cost 'this much' to repair or replace a roof after a covered peril (for ex., wind or hurricane), but it'll cost 'that much more' if solar panels were added.

Also, let's not forget that solar panels are not 'magically installed' onto a roof.  Holes need to be drilled into the roof for 'mounting hardware' and therefore, making the roof more susceptible to failure (rain intrusion).  Who has to deal with these claims and payouts?

Thanks to some trickery by the various Florida power companies when they'd floated our constitutional amendment regarding solar panels, all home solar systems in Florida MUST be connected to the power grid, MAY NOT have any energy storage capabilities (such as batteries) and therefore may only put the captured solar energy into the power grid, and MUST be powered down in the event of a power outage.  If a hurricane takes out the power grid, Florida law *prohibits* solar system owners from using their solar power systems!  

I'd damned near pulled my hair out while trying to get my fellow Floridians to actually read the proposed amendment, titled along the lines of ""Protecting Solar Power for Homeowners Amendment"" or some such garbage, instead of just listening to the title and thinking ""my, how nice and friendly!"", but nope.  The amendment wasn't very long, but taking the five minutes (literally) to read it was too much to ask of our citizens, so we are stuck with being told by the fossil-fuel power-plant operators when we may use our own, privately owned power generating solar panels.

Oh, and the payment from the power companies back to the homeowners for the power that is contributed to the grid are most likely to essentially evaporate.  The result will be, essentially, that the homeowner will pay for their own equipment but will be paid back for the energy at a rate of about half of what is paid to those commercial power companies when they sell to the local power company.  In other words, the solar-panel owning homeowner must pay for the equipment and then subsidize the power company that they are required to supply.  In other words, Floridians who install home-wide solar panel systems will have to pay MORE for their energy than those who simply purchase it from the power company.

Gee, it almost seems as if the power companies in Florida actually want to dissuade homeowners from installing and using solar panels.",none,,2023-12-02 21:36:00.944854,0.0

They're basically all out to protect other corporate interests not just throughout I mean it's like for instance you buy a modular home and or if you used to buy a brand new trailer at my new manufactured homes or not the nightmare they used to be back in the 670s and even to the '80s they're actually damn good quality but if you go and throw a wood stove and one of these every insurance company will have a fit.

And a lot of the times even without an it would stove you'll Play hell getting insurance and you'll find that you'll pay a higher rate of Farmers insurance it's pretty much the system is set up to where they don't want you living cheaply if they think that you're getting away with saving a couple of dollars on living expenses then there's always some entity that's going to find a way to builk you the difference.

And it's usually the insurance company I mean if you figured out how to heat your home with out using electric gas then the insurance companies conveniently going to have a problem with it if you figured out how to have a cheaper home than the insurance company is going to see to it that you're paying the difference what you're not paying a house payment to them.

The squeeze is on the squeeze is real.

Here's the track either renters are getting screwed by insurance companies most landlords and or apartment complexes require that you have renters insurance on the face of it Richards insurance was always somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 to 25 bucks a month it was a lot of money but of course those rates have gone up drastically in the past five years for most people and some of that depends upon location so the numbers are slightly fluent but the point is simply the minute that it was put in most leases as a requirement then the insurance companies came in and decided to charge whatever the fuck they wanted.",none,,2023-12-02 21:36:01.227773,0.0

As a contractor, I've roof mounted a lot equipment (CATV, MATV, SAT, A/V, CCTV, etc.) so what is surprising to me is how it took this long for Insurance co.'s to start backing out.

We learned that Elon did *not* make a decision to turn off Starlink service over Crimea ti foil an attack on Sevastopol.

Instead: the Biden Administration authorized Starlink sevice for Ukraine *except* for Crimea. On the eve of Ukraine's attack on Sevastopol, the Ukrainians called Elon and asked him to switch on service for Crimea. He didn't do it. But he said he would if the Biden Administration asked him to.

So, Elon was not making unlateral decisions affecting the war.

That was good to hear.

Dagen is spot on in saying Toyota got it right with hybrids!! For roughly the same amount of battery capacity, Ten or more hybrids can be built compared to only One fully electric EV. Do the math and youl'l find the savings in fossil fuel is much more significant with 10 hybrids on the road compared to 1 EV.

Most of the people who wanted an EV already have one. Tesla and the Chinese are only ones who are making a profit on EVs. There is not enough electric grid to handle a large number of new EVs. The cost to expand the electric grid should be payed for by the EV buyer. The Chinese learned that when they had to build three coal electric plants for one large city. Even Elon says the US should be drilling and refining more oil. End government rebates and let the consumer decide if they want to buy an EV. There is a place for EVs but it's not the mass adoption by 2032 that Biden says. In 20 to 25 years it could be more than 20% adoption if thats what people want. Advancements in technology in the next few years may help. Telsa hopes to create batteries with a range of 700 to 1000 miles that charge in 6 to 7 minutes to 100%. Right now EVs have a range of 140 to 500 miles depending on the vehicle and charge time can be hours. They are one or two decades from big breakthroughs.,none,,2023-12-02 21:36:15.734313,0.0

So standardize the packs so all manufacturers use the same one in a specific class and swap the things out.",none,,2023-12-02 21:36:16.742337,0.0

For the past year all they did was raise the amount you can earn before paying taxes. However, they will simply print the shortfall when everyone knows inflation for 2023 was at lest 10 percent. Whatever they print, will devalue the dollars purchasing power. So you're still paying for that money your government just counterfeited.

What the High Court of Australia found was that Victoria wasn't entitled to impose this road usage charge (tax) because that stood on the toes of the Federal Government that was the legitimate  authority (capable of imposing such a tax) in this case. Sorry to say, but such a tax could easily be imposed again at a later date by the Federal Government without complaint from the High Court.

The little guy didn't win more than a momentary reprieve here. The Federal Treasurer, however, won the day.

Also, it isn't true that the Victorian Government was forced to repay anything. They have done the right thing following the High Court finding of unconstitutionality of a State collecting an 'excise'. To repeat, the finding was that the Victorian Government usurped the role of the Federal Government not that the tax was bad or wrong.

And, the claim that Andrews (that is who Sam is talking about) departed the scene owing to the road usage tax debacle is gossipy nonsense that is beyond pathetic.",none,,2023-12-02 21:36:18.138405,3.0

Is it the vehicle business is so bad now that companies have to fund advertisments like these to sell their product to this yolo crowd? Or is it the Banks with their vehicle loan products sitting idle in these lean times. Either way this is a marketing blunder, specially for the vehicle brands. ""Luxury cars"" are for people who can afford ""luxury"". Attracting anyone who needs financing and expense advise to own one downgrades the brand value by feet (not inches). I have seen luxury car brands going the ""number of cars"" sold spree and sales number games, dropping prices, getting it available in second hand market, getting salaried people (it's not even a deputy c suit individual but some random being who thinks s/he can buy his/her way into being perceived as ""arrived"" somewhere in a overpriced chappal in a Westside sale!) and then wonder why their brand value took a nosedive. I mean seriously, some brand advertisements have gone from have only the car as the star to now have a paan  masala Bollywood star on the wheels. Brands have lost all self respect in the luxury segment. No wonder the next video suggestion is a ""passive income se ghar chalata hoon, salary ko haath nahi lagata"" video.

thank you.

We are witnessing the biggest evolution in motoring history since the model T.
Every car manufacturer, country and motorist are pondering, evaluating, questioning the EV, Hybrid, ICE development options.
What is becoming clearer each day, through the smoke of deception, lies, and ignorance are actual facts based on true data.
EV sales world wide are more than doubling each year, the motoring public are embracing the new technology despite less than perfect products, benefit verses risk assessment.
Those companies are therefore reducing costs, because battery performance, efficiency in production, reliability, constantly evolving advancement in overall developmental technology is allowing this to happen.
Despite political interference, apathy, negative publicity from oil companies and public ignorance, EVs continue to march on.
Sure we should constantly question, investigate, criticise, evaluate but definitely not turn our backs or perhaps dismiss it as folly.

Outside the EU, Japan and China, public mass transit isn't even viable in the near future, unless a drastic overhaul and investment is made.  
At present, the more viable option would be the hybrid versions, along with substantial focus on improving and extending public mass transit options.  Even streamlining a national fast rail project would provide some substantial improvements toward moving away from the reliance on gas/diesel markets.  Until some more substantial advances are made in those 'green energy' fields, to include the battery capacity, recycling and reduction in those toxic waste results, as well as speeding up those recharge times, it simply wouldn't be accepted on a national level.",none,,2023-12-02 21:36:29.793798,1.0

His parents took the best of care of his older brother that his father meant for the first son  So many have it wrong that Fres Trump build the empire to leave to Donald  Fred meant for his first son  Unfortunately his oldest brother got mixed up with alcohol, smoking , women in the Reserves  Yet the oldest always warned his younger brother Donald , do not ever start smoking, alcohol or drugs. Even when he let his younger brother tag alone with bim & his pals. His brother did not want to work, had big ideas of other ways to make his father's business money, with plane, yacht he bought & had hidden from his father  Alcohol can cause gran  delusions thinking he show his father by becoming a pilot for TWA, which he did ,yet lost his license within the first year due to alcohol. Fred Trumo & his wife unlike Joe Biden and his wife Jill, however it is incorrect to use gebder pronouns , so First Lady is out for Jill and we all know she is not a real doctor, she only decided to take on that honorable title on the campaign trail  Biden preached about not putting people with addictions who had committed crime, to send them to treatment centers. He never loved his last son alive to try to help him, Joe rather use Hunter to make deals and launder money for least we know 12 family members. We wonder how Jill could allow her husband to be made nothing but a joke, Biden does this on his own, always has yet he has mote serious cognitive issues that many of us recognized when he first announced  Why do you think Obama stepped in being with Joe when he did not endorse him.? Because the Democrats began getting nervous plus the fact Obama saw this as his third term he wanted so badly abd criticized the Constitution for limiting the President to two terms  This is why we the people must speak and demand now that a wife of a formed president shall not be allowed to run for the office of President  This way a couple could carry 16 years destroying the Country as Obama started the last down hill with those in the 50's, his ideologies the Democrat party have eqch completely changed from the way once believed , even Biden yet I do not feel BIDEN has changed, I think he is as racist as he ever was and the people hear and see it  TRUMPS parents sent their son to rehab and took care of him in their own home, after left his family, and Fred Trump and his wife still took good care of the wife as it was no longer safe for the children or her to stay with him and Donald abd Ivanka visited at parents home  Sadly the alcoholism finally killed the oldest son. Donald Trump just graduating had to step up  He was use to working, being around the workers,, learned from his dad as Donald Trump's three oldest learned by being on the construction site working for one of the contractors.. Donald Trump knows how the whole family is affected and times the spouse or child becomes sicker by the roles  I think it is wonderful to have a President that does not drink alcohol nor the wife or children. Trump is loyal to his family, friends, and does not like to take against his brother & he will not  Rather he will share what his older brother drilled into him and he taught his children the same. God is the basis for how the 12 step programs work  So when Trump says it takes God,family, rehab, times families need time off. Many of the alcoholics are dual diagnosis,  meaning there is another disorder .President Trump has such a wide range of wisdom in so many areas  Instead of Austin stating "" We hoped China would back off after their latest stunt  "" We Hoped!""!!!!!! Trump would told then when the balloon came over, first he would had it shot down, destroyed then on the phone telling China just how much their stunt cost China!",none,,2023-12-02 21:36:31.031011,0.0

No one wants to work in America anymore. They want the money, but don’t want to work for it. Faith? Jesus said, “ When the Son of Man returns will he find faith on the Earth?” (Luke 18:8). I’m of the persuasion were only one generation away from the complete disregard and unbelief in the reality of Biblical truth. We see Jesus (not Muhammad) being mocked in film, books etc. Family? We’ve seen over the last three decades and more so the last two years the assault on the nuclear family dynamic to destroy it. Why? Well, the man and woman relation as we know it is being destroyed. Husband, wife and children. Gods design- and if it’s Gods design, this world cannot stand for it. We want to do it our way. We’ve spiraled into a godless nation, and I believe we’re seeing the fruits (judgement?) of our rejection of the One who gave his only Son to die for the sins of the world. “He who rejects the Son, also rejects Him who sent him”. But to the believer I say- hold on to what you have! Don’t give up nor give in the the wisdom of this world. Remember, “There seems to be a way that’s right in a man’s eyes, but that way leads to destruction”. But can it change? “With men it is impossible, but with God, all things are possible”.",none,,2023-12-02 21:36:31.243414,0.0

The fact is, EVs will prove to be both more economical and more reliable. Most people will make the logical choice to switch. Others will be forced as ICE companies fail to be profitable due to loss of economies of scale. ICE car availability will naturally dry up due to market conditions.

I also know my 10 year old daughter will likely never own an ice car…

Pretty sure my 46 year old wife owns her last ice…

I’m 56 and could see owning an ice truck for a while because no sign of a “real” electric work truck on the horizon and I am not going to spend over 40,000-50,000 so I have no choice but to buy used ice for a while…maybe 10 years from now🤷🏻‍♂️…if I take care of current truck maybe there is a chance used heavy duty electric pickups will have been around long enough to be available used and my next purchase…not holding my breathe.

That’s my reality…one can be totally pro evs and also believe ice will be around for another 40+ years…

You are  going to need a proportional scaled Grid & Transmission system, right from Generation through to Distribution..to match this consumption... Separate and ON TOP of the Grid and Transmission system that you already have that currently supplies Energy to your Industrial/Commercial and Residential consumers and customers. Existing Main 'backbone' Grid and transmission systems by the way that in more cases than not, are aging/ have had little or no real meaningful infrastructure Upgrades probably getting on in years (up to 60 to 70 years in some cases) ie  Wind turbine farms or Solar arrays alone are not going meet the massive total energy need required if you need that energy available for charging a n EV on a  24/7 basis ( at Night, and when the wind isn't blowing). Ok lets look at the boring stuff for a moment. Outside of  a specific Commercial Charging station... of which this still applies on another scale... lets look at a street or cul-de-sac of 10 homes for application of domestic charging of EVs. They would each  need a max supply of 16A, on a single phase supply...and yes it doesn't mean 16A is used, but must be available... (remember they already have an existing house supply burden).. so a specific metered pilot system would need to be installed, for each domestic charging setup. That means for just 10 houses x 16A is 160A. needs to be supplied by a transformer via an LV pilot network. NOT the already existing transformer supplying these 10 houses with its normal supply... ANOTHER Transformer,  will also need to be installed, that will need to have  3 phases HV and LV supplies balanced for Distribution purposes. So you can now expand this small 10 house example, to the very real 100s and 1000s of houses that the astronomical installation Costs this would apply, to see how unrealistic that just EVs ALONE are going to be the whole future of vehicle travel.

The problem pointed out is that Toyota's hydrogen ICE engine will use a lot of hydrogen, so even going 300 miles on a tank of hydrogen will require an extra large tank. How large? Well, one of the problems with hydrogen is that it is much less energy dense than gasoline, in other words, to store the equivalent of a gallon of gasoline  take an awful lot of space.The tank will take up most of the entire back seat, and the trunk of a car. Since hydrogen refueling stations will be very scarce for a very long time, maybe you want a 500 mile tank.

 Hydrogen engines are not the answer for cars. Why ?
1. You can't recharge at home - the most major drawback.
2. Hydrogen charging stations are scarce, Pretty impossible to plan any long distance trip.
3. Hydrogen charging stations are very expensive to build - up to $1 million each.
4. The mechanics take up the whole hood and trunk leaving no space for suitcases etc.
5. Slow acceleration. No match for EVs.
6. Hydrogen is stored in long tubes so what happens in a major collision?
7. Cost of maintenance is high.
8. Heavy depreciation. A new Toyota Mirai can cost up to $70,000. Used ones sell for as low as $8,000 reflecting little demand for them. Not a good investment,

Human nature is the desire to receive, also called “desire to enjoy,” and it functions by receiving what is beneficial to itself and rejecting what is harmful. Everything in our lives is built upon this calculation where we first try to distance ourselves from harm, and then seek how to draw ourselves closer to what is beneficial.
Human nature also includes a multilayering of systems that work simultaneously on still, vegetative, animate and human levels. One of those systems is our bodily one, which operates involuntarily. If our bodies are healthy, then they know what is good for them and draw that goodness to themselves. After the bodily system, there is the emotional system, which also functions relatively according to instinct. From the emotional system, we move to the mind, and from the mind to the intellect, and so on. That is, we have systems over systems that concurrently work on receiving what is beneficial and rejecting what is harmful.
Such is human nature and the essence of our lives. Our every desire, thought and action operates according to the calculation, “How can we receive what is most beneficial to us and reject what is harmful?”",none,,2023-12-02 21:37:05.789152,0.0

 Ammonia aka nitrogen hydrogen 3 NH3 is a cheap renewable  fuel that can be used in any gasoline engine and diesel with minor modifications.  Look up videos of ammonia as fuel. And you will see you've been lied to for nearly a 100yrs about needing  oil gas, solar wind, nuclear,  and now electric cars 
   Ammonia has been used as a  fuel before gasoline or diesel fuel even existed.. Ammonia engines existed before the combustion engine. 
Ammonia was used in 1960s Nasa space race,  it is still used in rocket fuel, aviation fuel, race car fuel. A rocket car running off straight ammonia holds the land speed record. There is more energy available in ammonia than gasoline,  diesel,  ethanol.  
You don't hear about ammonia as a fuel  because of corrupt politicians and corporations  know it will destroy the oil gas, electric car,  solar wind,  nuclear power,  power grid companies.
All takes to run a gasoline engine car, truck, boat , generator etc off ammonia is a propane tank and 2nd fuel pump set set up. a diesel need a propane tank fuel pump and a cpu tunner kit to get compression right.  
You can make ammonia at home or buy ammonia making processor, and easily made anywhere in the world even in the most poorest nations.  
Ammonia is made by pulling nitrogen from air, bonding it with hydrogen through Electrolysis with water and bumping off oxygen.

If others start to adopt Tesla, all Tesla has to do is begin to charge for using its technology through licensing agreements. If Tesla garners enough licensing revenue, it will give Tesla a competitive advantage not only with revenue, but also because they have the equity of a charging network. Let’s also talk about capacity. As Tesla continues to grow, the network will get strained, especially at tourist, and high traffic locations. Problem solution is to install more stations, but if Tesla has the infrastructure, the onus will be on them to add additional charging stations, in turn, once again adding value to Tesla. Today Ford wants to adopt the Tesla infrastructure, and tomorrow they will want to adopt the FSD software for Ford vehicles, again a revenue multiplier for Tesla, not Ford. This is actually going to make Tesla a stronger brand, because you’re now creating brand dependence. How does a CEO not see this, and see so short term? Better off competing head on, and buying existing gas stations (known great locations) and converting them to EV charging centers.

This move by Ford will help solidify the standard hopefully in favor of the Tesla standard finally which is one of the last pieces of the puzzle to the ev problem. 

After a charging standard is adopted by everyone, then it becomes much more seamless to adopt an ev and be able to live with it on a daily basis. CCS was thought to be that standard but it’s just not a reliable and good enough charging solution so switching to the Tesla charging solution which has far more chargers available anyways is truly the best move. It’s also far more reliable, easier to use, works well in the cold and the hot weather, etc. To me Ford making this switch will really up the competition for sure with Ford EVs.

I have a feeling the partnership with Ford will allow more Superchargers to be built which will support All EVs which will be a good thing as other public chargers are slow if they even work at all.

BRICS is growing and China and Russia alone have increased bilateral trade. The West has pushed the 2 nations, Russia with the largest and most complete stockpile of natural resources in the world to together with China, the largest manufacturing base in history together. China that still supplies 45%+ of the goods consumed by the West, plus 60% of engineering equipment, and is expanding it's trade all over the globe to the majority of countries that are finished with Western Hypocrisy and imperialism.

1. No foreign car manufacturers can use the power of Money, Technology, or scale to ""Dominate and create a monopoly"", they have to invest in India.
2. As they invest in India creates jobs, it generates trade (like raw materials and other parts) more locally manufactured parts, etc.
3. the Indian car manufacturers get competition (ex. how TATA and Mahindra had to innovate to counter Huyndai and Toyota).  They also now use high quality parts that market which was basically created to these brand's specification. (ex. MAchine cut alloy wheels, or soft touch materials in interiors and many other) 
4. MOST IMPORTANTLY: if you buy a fully foreign-made imported car 100% of the money goes outside India dec. Indian economy, if let say they take some profit out which could 10-12% (companies could go in losses too) then 88%-90% of that money stays in Indian economy system.

 however, they prioritize the manufacturing of these cars within India. By imposing import duties on cars, the government provides car companies to manufacture vehicles domestically.

When we purchase a foreign car for 20 rupees, the Indian government receives 10 rupees, and the Reserve Bank of India needs to provide a dollar equivalent of 10 rupees to the exporting company. This scenario is considered unfavorable for the Indian economy.

On the other hand, if we buy a similar quality car manufactured in India for 15 rupees, the government receives the entire 15 rupees. (Win-win for everyone) This is because none of the money spent on the car leaves India, and it circulates within the domestic economy, ultimately contributing to government revenue through recursive tax.

I understand that these vehicles are from vastly different segments, and there is a significant difference in price and brand value. However, they all offer similar features, space, and performance.

Hydrogen is very difficult gas to store. Hydrogen is such a tiny molecule it leaks thru most seals. It even leaks thru the pores of metals. U need special costly metals to line the interior of any pipes that move hydrogen. Hydrogen will eventually leak into the atmosphere. It's estimated that your fully charged hydrogen car will leak out all it's hydrogen in 15 days!. U better have the hydrogen vented away from a confined space as hydrogen gas is a Xplosive.....Just look up the Hindenburg dirigible disaster. Since hydrogen is so difficult to transport......this is why most industries that use hydrogen.....generate hydrogen at the place where it will be used. Hydrogen has less energy than other fuels. This means u will need to haul around more hydrogen to get the same work done from it say from a smaller tank of gas or battery pack. The hydrogen engine must operate at higher pressures and temperatures than other internal combustion engines. This means more wear and tear over time and greater frequency of repairs. Given that there is no hydrogen infrastructure.........it will be more difficult and costly to charge a hydrogen car.

Hydrogen fools cells are not the future and hydrogen combustion is even less feasible:
- Energy losses are too high. A minimum of 30 % heat loss
- Power losses are too high. A 30% loss compared to gas or diesel
- Boost power by increasing chamber pressure and NOX emissions go through the roof

- Source to wheels emissions are as bad or worse than gas or diesel if from fossil sources
- Make it from green sources and cost (at the pump) is 3 to 4 X gas
- Make it from fossil sources and cost (at the pump) is twice that of gas
- It takes 20 times as many delivery trucks because of poor volumetric energy density of hydrogen

That what else might just make that old technology completely well 12th century in comparison. I don't know what it is. It may be something we find on an asteroid in the belt by Mars or we may start to study the Sun enough that we catch upon something that wasn't thought of, some way of focusing energy to start the fusion chain reaction and also to be able to contain the fusion and add more tritium to fuse in a sustained process. 

Maybe we stumble upon something deep inside the Earth, maybe we start to learn how to harness the energy of the sub-crustal Mantle. I don't know. But there are smart people out there NOT watching YouTube tonight, but instead are thinking of things we here in ""stupid land"" can't even begin to fathom.

It's coming.

Real Change

People are easy to foul. 
Manipulation rules. 
Logic dictates that majority should rule, dictate what should be done. 

Our world is not like that, for the people by the people does not happen. 

True science also is manipulated and we can not have real discussion. 

There is another agenda behind the scenes, the more the people are confused they rule. 

We need to wake up all of this is to distract us so they can go forward with their agenda. 

Our science has not advanced enough to be 100% true. 

We are been fulled we need to wake up. 

We can solve hunger, injustice etc, 

If all good people unite we rule and can stop all of the stupidity that is going on. 

Awareness is the answer. 

USA two parties that differ in minor things they are 90% the same and they have the people at war. This is illogical. 

We have been mislead since the feudal times. 

We with knowledge as of today should stand up and say no more. 

It is time for the majority to stand up unite and make this earth a true humane place. 

It is time for a peaceful revolution. 

If good people unite we can stop all of the manipulation that is done to simply distract us all. 

It is time for the good people to stand up an fight in history we have been passive. 

Our leaders really do not represent us, we have a faulty system that places them in power. 

We need to re think how real democracy can be re installed. 

Our real needs are not met because of this. 

We the people do not want wars and conflicts but that is all we get. The system has to change.

We as a majority if united can make it happen. 

It is time to find a real humanized leader to accomplish this goal. 

Awareness is the answer.

The Netherlands is only a kingdom from 1815 onwards. It was actually one of the first well designed modern republics until the Ancient Regimes of the allied powers after the Napoleonic wars installed the son of a former stadholder as king. Unfortunately, we’re still a kingdom.

Anyway. The king this video speaks about is not a king. It was a count. In the year 1340. Just 500 years before the Netherlands actually became a kingdom. The picture is also incorrect.

Many of them have the commanding position in their respective fields too.   For example, the mirrors in the ASML machine are made by Germany's Zeiss and state of the art.   Said differently, ASML's equipment is NOT one technology but an ECOSYSTEM of many different disciplines.   Therefore, even if China can replicate ASML as a system integrator, its ability to produce finish goods still hinges on the 5000 suppliers being allowed to export to China!   Can China become number one in 5000 different fields and become totally independent?   Further, buying equipment and how you use it are two different subjects!   I can buy the same oven used by a world famous chef, but I can't bake award-winning cookies because that chef has his secret recipes but I follow the cookbook that comes with the oven.   NO semiconductor manufacturing companies follow the recipes that come with the equipment!   This is why though Intel can buy the same equipment from ASML like TSMC, Intel is no match for TSMC.  The latter has developed  much more advanced recipes that are years ahead.   In summary, no one single company can control the semiconductor ""industry"" (more of an ecosystem of thousands of different technologies).

But, I think you are actually missing the true root causes of the ongoing conflicts in the region. A very compelling alternative to this can be found in the book ""The Long Great War"" by Jonathan Wyrtzen. The accepted narrative for regional conflict that blames colonially imposed borders misses the fact that the region has many local groups vying for control, as well as deep underlying cultural acceptance of conflict as the primary means of dealing with disagreements. In other words, assuming that if colonial powers had not drawn these borders, the region would have ascended into some utopian peace is not based on any historical precedence. This leads to regional leaders blaming others for ongoing conflict instead of taking responsibility for it themselves. In short, this continued narrative is partly to blame for the ongoing conflict, and should be reconsidered.",none,,2023-12-02 21:37:28.730475,0.0

In fact if Israel destroy HAMAS then whaever dream Erdogan can not exist. If Palestinians have a state at Gaza and wherever else, and Israel agrees on, that  canal existing could make Palestines a state to exist and their people to work and have a job.

If HAMAS and Turkey move on like it then all could exist is a never-ending war. This is the real deal for Erdogan as they struggle to push away Kurds from Syria, Iraq and total ruled by oppression against ethinc Kurds of Turkey. The ultimate scope of Erdogan is to drain Palestinians from Gaza and populate land of Cyprus, Syria, Turkey and Iraq  with them after cleansing those territories calling them ""Turks"" or NeoTurks, allowing HAMAS to rule under his orders under Islam on Gaza threatening Israel, hoping its final solution. That is the destruction of their state making Iranians happy under their puppets and proxy war army Hesbolah in Libabon. This is rediculus if Erdogan believes that can happen. It is so filthy and that even NAZIS did not do in WW2.

That is why Erdogan sends millons people to Europe bying their freedom in billions of US dollars and euros under the filthiest conditions using that money to buy weapons for his intentions and HAMAS under his name as papa Erdogan or little dad sultan for the ""sake"" of Islam but in fact its worst than the crematoria of Autzwitz as  some of them are  paid to be wolves killing people willing to be suicide bombs for sake of Islam as radical were taught to exist and hate and never co-exist with the West as the west are the disobediend the filthy and dirtiest (Which in fact is true since West civilization is in disgrace with policy and politistim terms exit - However  how about the East or how Erdogan thinks about the West?

The reason is why the Romans gave the the name Palaistine where ethnic nations existed there to imped mostly the Judes to rule and perform policy on Roman Empire. Judes had lands there that were the owners but where creative and smart they had money and trade power. They disliked the Romans cuase that was their land and the name was given to pose threats to them. Palaistines where called as the rest population revoluted against Roman army to end occupation. But those were not capable enough as had no money and could not defeat the Roman army.  It is that name given that included everything, considering Arabs, Egyptians and names where given according the city they came from. It was very difficult for the Romans to handle all these but no way fro their tactics to name it Israel as that was the real deal for Judes as they needed that part of land for themselves. The Judes acted on behalf of their interests until they were capable enough. However during the Byzantine empire and Ottoman Empire Judes were disparsed all over the world but as there exist a ""promise"" land for them they never gave up that dream. During the ending years of Ottoman empire as Greek Revolution was the start and the Ottmans/Turks ruled at least for 400 years strictly under no free religion and taxes under obeying the SULTAN or you head is cut off with the ultimate scope to change the ethnic groups into Turks under Islam no matter what ethnic group you were before. (Of course that exactly feature leaded to revolutions and the dismantle of Ottoman Empire and still many Turks mainly try to oevrcome this as all are Turks but is a complete lie - Even to be called a Turk in Ottoman empire was like an insult as meaning a person completely uneducated showing no interest to create as wanderer - Turkmans were that mostly ) This exact problem is the greatest problem of NeoTurks or Neo Ottomans today which basically is the fear of dismantling since ethnic groups are still inside Turkey (Kurdic problem) and Turks based their policy on the army  as Kemals policy existed only on power. Even today Turkey as Erdogan is the complete dominant factor does exactly the same but under Islam. The cover is different the scope is the same. That is why Erdogan simply destroyed Kemalism with in his army (2015/2016 miliary ""coup"" designed by iIslamists to overun Kemalism and rule Turkey under stricked policies against west values and international law/ethos)   and hates Kemalism but for his tactic he ""respects"" Kemal Attaturk. In fact Erdogan wants to be a superior person than Attaturk. So he designes his plans against Greece, Cyprus, Syria declaring always as  threatened by Greece BUT HE IS ONE that actually attacks. Remember Cyprus is divided and occupied by troops. MAVI VATAN is his policy against Greece stating Greek islands are  ""occupied"" and want them with no army as ""afraid"" (still his army are opposite the Greek islands especially Kastelorizo) and now he tries to rule Libya  to attack greece interests on energy sources. 12 miles is not option for Greece as Turkey feels threatened as Turkey have not signed UNCLOS for economi zones up to 12 miles for every country and will never.  However Turkey uses that as normality on  the Black Sea oppposite Russians /Ukraine and Bulgaria.  ALL THIS POLICY  IS BULL SHIT and of course is the need for Turkey for power to keep her problems under the carpet with the islam cover up and the tale ""since you speak Turk and love Islam came as you are and you are welcomed as interests on energy as geopolitics talk comes first !! How about Palestines? Of course when the Ottoman Empire was under collapse Sultan Abdul Hamid as economy in their empire was non existent and debts skyrocketed sold the land to Judes after he bought it from populations including Palestines or even sold it illegally. So the Turks sold parts of land to Judes belonging to everyone else except Judes, sold land that long before belonged to Judes and they bought it again or gave it with money in return. In fact the Turks sold that land as an agreement existed with Judes and Sultan Hamid with the British help for his debts to weapons he get from loans from others (could be anyone including Germans, Russians etc). Hamid was eager to improve finance but was in fact in vain Judes were eager to return to their ""promise"" land no matter the cost. So the Empire collapsed and British took over to these places to act as ""owners"" untill all places have their true owner. Exact the same happened in Cyprus as the Turks (Turks were/are always considering money without caring of what they sell and later they do everything to regain with any kind of mean.  Feel sorry for Turks and this is a ""Turkish bargain"" in reality) sold the island to British hoping one day will return under any means (and if no Turk is there we should invent them there.  Sorry again its the policyand tactic so together with greeks as guarranteed owners for peace when problems arosed they found the time to settle things their way ...of course by invasion and destruction) So how is now Palestine in midde East.

It was very difficult for the Romans to handle all these but no way fro their tactics to name it Israel as that was the real deal for Judes as they needed that part of land for themselves. The Judes acted on behalf of their interests until they were capable enough. However during the Byzantine empire and Ottoman Empire Judes were disparsed all over the world but as there exist a ""promise"" land for them they never gave up that dream. During the ending years of Ottoman empire as Greek Revolution was the start and the Ottmans/Turks ruled at least for 400 years strictly under no free religion and taxes under obeying the SULTAN or you head is cut off with the ultimate scope to change the ethnic groups into Turks under Islam no matter what ethnic group you were before. (Of course that exactly feature leaded to revolutions and the dismantle of Ottoman Empire and still many Turks mainly try to oevrcome this as all are Turks but is a complete lie - Even to be called a Turk in Ottoman empire was like an insult as meaning a person completely uneducated showing no interest to create as wanderer - Turkmans were that mostly ) This exact problem is the greatest problem of NeoTurks or Neo Ottomans today which basically is the fear of dismantling since ethnic groups are still inside Turkey (Kurdic problem) and Turks based their policy on the army  as Kemals policy existed only on power. Even today Turkey as Erdogan is the complete dominant factor does exactly the same but under Islam. The cover is different the scope is the same. That is why Erdogan simply destroyed Kemalism with in his army (2015/2016 miliary ""coup"" designed by iIslamists to overun Kemalism and rule Turkey under stricked policies against west values and international law/ethos)   and hates Kemalism but for his tactic he ""respects"" Kemal Attaturk. In fact Erdogan wants to be a superior person than Attaturk. So he designes his plans against Greece, Cyprus, Syria declaring always as  threatened by Greece BUT HE IS ONE that actually attacks. Remember Cyprus is divided and occupied by troops. MAVI VATAN is his policy against Greece stating Greek islands are  ""occupied"" and want them with no army as ""afraid"" (still his army are opposite the Greek islands especially Kastelorizo) and now he tries to rule Libya  to attack greece interests on energy sources. 12 miles is not option for Greece as Turkey feels threatened as Turkey have not signed UNCLOS for economi zones up to 12 miles for every country and will never.  However Turkey uses that as normality on  the Black Sea oppposite Russians /Ukraine and Bulgaria.  ALL THIS POLICY  IS BULL SHIT and of course is the need for Turkey for power to keep her problems under the carpet with the islam cover up and the tale ""since you speak Turk and love Islam came as you are and you are welcomed as interests on energy as geopolitics talk comes first !! How about Palestines? Of course when the Ottoman Empire was under collapse Sultan Abdul Hamid as economy in their empire was non existent and debts skyrocketed sold the land to Judes after he bought it from populations including Palestines or even sold it illegally. So the Turks sold parts of land to Judes belonging to everyone else except Judes, sold land that long before belonged to Judes and they bought it again or gave it with money in return. In fact the Turks sold that land as an agreement existed with Judes and Sultan Hamid with the British help for his debts to weapons he get from loans from others (could be anyone including Germans, Russians etc). Hamid was eager to improve finance but was in fact in vain Judes were eager to return to their ""promise"" land no matter the cost. So the Empire collapsed and British took over to these places to act as ""owners"" untill all places have their true owner. Exact the same happened in Cyprus as the Turks (Turks were/are always considering money without caring of what they sell and later they do everything to regain with any kind of mean.  Feel sorry for Turks and this is a ""Turkish bargain"" in reality) sold the island to British hoping one day will return under any means (and if no Turk is there we should invent them there.  Sorry again its the policyand tactic so together with greeks as guarranteed owners for peace when problems arosed they found the time to settle things their way ...of course by invasion and destruction) So how is now Palestine in midde East. Hamas headquarters existing in Instabul of Turkey wants the complete destuction o Israel but Turks dont really care about Palestine but energy sourses and piplelines in Gaza financial economic zone. Isreal wants to create in long term a way that connects  Eliat to to Israel.  (part 1)",none,,2023-12-02 21:37:28.730648,0.0

Groups that are highly exclusive (e.g. a country with only one religious/ethnic group) are prone to great racism and to not play well with other countries with differing opinions (e.g. European countries and their lack of respect for other cultures). This too would have resulted in wars, especially with the oil, arable land and water conflicts that would have caused tension.

Anything called religion is superficial including abrahamic judaism/christianity/islam full of scam.
Nothing surprising whole Europe, USA, Western world, Middle East and surrounding were and will always be forever real third world, the poorest nature in the world.
Real Rich will never colonize other.

Thus not a complete multiracial not multilingual never been living around the world all alone since childhood are just the same never evolved dumb apes stuck inside your tiny boxes your entire life and not learning from the past to evolve better.

Indonesia was not, is not and will never be Islamic country.
World map is inaccurate since Mercator projection 1569.
In reality Indonesia is huge as Russia including our ocean and even much richer.
Even much bigger before West and Middle East came took our former Australia, Singapore, Malaysia+Brunei, South Thailand, The Philippines, Vietnam even Madagascar Africa.
Actually countries in Europe are just regencies and provinces in Indonesia.

Egypt isn't the oldest, even Egypt is very poor, very dry, far off the center of the Equator line.
Most highest humidity on Earth: Indonesia, meaning many much older artifacts has decayed much faster than just few thousands years Egypt.
And Judaism/Christianity/Islam are just the same dumb.
Even most of people know nothing about much older ancient modern civilization here in Indonesia before mega eruption of Toba supervolcano of Sumatra 75,000 years ago.
Including 25,000 years old Gunung Padang pyramid in Indonesia.

Hindu isn't from India either. Original Hindu is Indonesia not in India. 
Hindu in India and in Bali are totally different
Indus, Indo, Hindia, Hindu = Indus Islands = Indo Nesos = Indonesia.
The same with Astrology came from Indonesia not by the Greeks, Egyptians nor Aramaic/Arabs/Jews.
Judaism, Christianity and Islam are just frauds branches of modified Hinduism in India.
Real Hindu came from Indonesia not India.
Hindu, Hindia, Indus, Indo, etc = Indo Nesos, Indus islands, Indonesia over 17000 islands, exactly on the center of the equator line, the center of all civilization, all Indo around the world came from here especially because of eruption of Toba supervolcano Sumatra 75000 years ago bigger than Yellowstone USA, resulted today world's largest volcanic lake Toba Sumatra.
Yet, world map is wrong since Mercator projection 1569, real Indonesia is Huge as Russia and even much richer than the rest of the world.
Dutch VOC was much richer than any present day world's richest company.
Whole Europe, USA, etc western world in general were built with Indonesia's limitless wealth.
Coffee is native in Indonesia not brought by the Dutch.
Too many lies they wrote about Indonesia even at formal school books!

The fact is whole Europe has been built with Indonesia's wealth for centuries by mentally and intellectually they hasn't changed a bit.

While the state borders of Israel may have had a higher proportion of Jews, the original British Mandate included what is now Jordan and ALL of that land was given to the local Arabs, who were the exact same ethnic group to what we now call Palestinians. So, the Arab locals actually got 75% of the British Mandate of Palestine if you include Jordan, while the Jews were left with the most arid and swampy (ie malaria ridden) land areas of Israel. Also important to reiterate that the Arab leaders rejected the Partition Plan of a Jewish State and Arab State, and those Arab leaders were the ones who told the local Arab villages to clear out so they could fight an unnecessary war, NOT the Jewish leadership. All Arabs who remained on their property within Israel were granted citizenship, which they enjoy today as Arab-Israelis (and ask any of them, they prefer being Israeli to being Palestinian 100%). 

And if anyone wants to bring up the Nakba and cite the violence of Deir Yassin (which was a terrible tragedy committed by extremists and heavily condemned by Jewish leadership), I challenge you to come up with one OTHER example that occurred in an Arab village during that time.

2. I just wanted to mention that there was a plan before the partition plan you showed (1947) of israel-palestine. Before that plan there was a plan from the Peel Commission to give 80% of the land to arabs and 20% inhabitable land to the jews. They still disagreed. So they didnt think it wasnt fair, they just wanted to erase the jewish history of Israel. So the independance war started in 1947, between the jews and the arabs, the arabs were the majority but still needed help. So in 14th of may 1948 the near by arab states invade israel. Because they diclaire their independance. So the israeli army was created and they understood that the arabs wont accept any plan who will acknowledge a jewish state so they decided to ""concour"" more land. Also the plan you mentioned, the partition was 45% to the arabs and 55% to the jews, the jews largest land was mostly a desert. Also 50% of the jews in israel at that time and still today, ( in the early 20th century) there was million jews in arab countries and they were banished from iraq, iran, egypt and several more arab countries, so not only ""europian jews) came to Israel.
If you guys want to learn more about the conflict I can send u a link.

The Kurds deserve their own homeland, and the region would've been much more peaceful over the decades for it! The Turks would not have had reason to unfairly brandish them as terrorists . . . it's Turkey that terrorizes the Kurds for wanting their own territory that Turkey simply is not willing to give up.
If the Kurds had their own lands, then it probably would mean that there wouldn't need to be any more violence.

*I have often wondered what would have happened if the victors of WW1 had agreed to make an* "" *international zone* ""
in a teardrop shape from the Mediterranean and encompassing (around) the (slightly) a enlarged area of Jerusalem. 
Within this zone a new port could have been built for the international soldiers/administrators for this district and
borders (fences, etc.) built and administered by the allies until the UN was up and running. Those who were already 
living within this zone could have stayed. Migration into the international zone banned (but day laborers allowed)

Jews could have been given the area north of this international barrier.  Arabs south of the border and joined to
the country of Jordan as Jordanian citizens.  The people living within this zone could have received citizenship
in either the Jewish or Arab districts. THEN  SLOWLY, ever so slowly and PEACEFULLY, people could buy land 
and give the displaced peasants a stipend and assistance to move to their respective areas.

Because, the land of Israel/Palestine is not very fertile:
It would have been helpful if Christian Arabs were given a guarantee that they could relocate to already
established Christian Arab communities in USA, UK, France and Argentina.  They would have assimilated 
well in those countries.

In addition, international aid could have been given to the Jordanian government to create new cities and 
to resettle people. Brits and Americans could have been encouraged to build factories too and trade
agreements made.  Aid to KSA to develop its petroleum industry could have been tied to guarantees
of jobs for Jordanian Arabs.

You failed to mention on 17:07 that the large portion of the land designated for the Jewish state by the UN in their partition plan is actually uninhabitable desert of Negev on the south and malaria infested swamps and rocky terrain on north, so the Jews essentially got the worst parts of the Mandate. 

You also failed to mention (although you kind of showed it on the map) that the Mandate for Palestine included Transjordan which was created as a independent Arab state by the British as a reward for Arab Revolt agains the Ottomans. The country was assigned to one of the sons of the Hashemites dynasty from Arabian Peninsula, so technically the Arabs of Mandate Palestine did get their own state of a very substantial size (although lots of it is uninhabitable desert).

When you talk about Arab refugees escaping from the Mandate Palestine (Nakba), you failed to mention the 800,000 Jewish refugees from Muslim countries that escaped persecution in their countries of origin. As the result the Jewish refugees from Muslim countries were successfully integrated in Israeli society, while the Arab refugees were left in perpetual refugee status by their Arab brothers to be used as a political pawn. Palestinian refugees today are the only group of refugees in the history of the world to pass their refugee status to the next generations.",none,,2023-12-02 21:37:29.960747,11.0

And I’ve known people who can’t get a job become they can’t get a car, and they can’t get a car because they can’t get a job.

I think if all car rental companies would have opened many more small businesses in many areas where people lived, and if it didn’t cost much, then they could have rented a car, since they couldn’t afford to buy one, and didn’t need to buy one, there could have been fewer cars on the roads to stop traffic congestion and polluted air and land that’s killing us all.
Even today, if there were more rental offices near senior housing sites, they wouldn’t have to buy their own car. Cars are expensive and cost a lot in maintenance, that most seniors can’t afford, so seniors could rent a car 1-2 times a week, and wouldn’t need their own expensive car.

then it was another hour wait to get to the wicket  
then onother hour drive back to the sirport to get my buddies

While I was in the hour long line at Alamo  I noticed a shorter line where I counted 30 people in it 
I asked what that was all about?
Turns out that was the "" fender bender "" line People that had accidents !
For the people that never got the $5 insurance it was a night mare !
The bosses wife went cheap as possible! The car was already booked  .
When I was asked if I wanted
 insurance ?

For (2) of your 'hacks', you left off the key part of the information, the 'why' for the hack that explains why it will work because that helps people to understand changes they can make without just being random.  

First, the 1 hr difference.  The key to know is that almost all rental car companies rent on the 24 hour day.  So, this hack is only going to work if your removed hour is going from 25 hours to 24 hours.  A 'sub-hack' for this is to know that most rental car companies work in terms of 'real' time.  If you made the reservation for 9am and end up picking up the car at 9:15am, your reservation doesn't start until 9:15am and you don't have to return it until 9:15am the next day.  Also most give you a bit of a buffer.  In this same situation, most will let you return the car at 9:45am without extra charges....But, be sure to read the fine print. 


Second, the 5 to 7 days price decrease.  Since you didn't mention it, I doubt people realize the reason for the major difference is because of the WEEKLY vs DAILY rate.  Most rental agencies give you a much better rate for a weekly rental versus individual days, meaning there is often a break-even point in the 4-6 day range at which point, the week becomes cheaper.  Great idea, but you missed the opportunity to explain why the hack worked.",none,,2023-12-02 21:37:33.950747,0.0
