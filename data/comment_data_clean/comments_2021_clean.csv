This one's about our Govt‚Äôs EV ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù aka ‚ÄúThe Future Fuels Strategy‚Äù, aka FFS. And no that‚Äôs not satire, it‚Äôs what they really called it‚Ä¶ presumably in an attempt to put satirists out of work üò§ I had to also make a special mention of the Victorian State Govt (which I think normally does a lot of good things) given their decision to introduce a tax on EVs. Victoria will be voting on the EV tax in early May so if you want to let them know how you feel about it, here's a petitioon that will be hand-delivered to crossbench MPs ahead of the vote. Please add your name: https://nb.tai.org.au/dump_ev_tax

There was so much to say on this topic that I couldn‚Äôt fit in the video. But that‚Äôs exactly where the Juice Media Podcast comes in handy as a companion to the video, allowing us to go into more detail. I'm stoked to have as my guest Ketan Joshi - so stay tuned: the podcast will be coming out next week!

Turns out a little more research should have been done. Here are a few highlights. For the amount of pollution it takes to make one EV you can make about 15 hybrids and about 50 gas burners. You have to drive the E.V. about 100,000 miles to offset the initial pollution. By that time you will need a new battery. At least $20.000 for a Tesla battery and $35,000 for a new high-end luxury car battery. Oh no, you now have to drive another 30 to 40 thousand miles to offset the pollution created by the new battery manufacturing. Not to mention where the used battery goes. Look into it, the recycling of these large batteries is not what you would think. Also, you will never match the range, convenience, and towing capacity over distance of a hybrid or fossil-fuel engine. Also, the major car companies around the world have lost Hundreds of Billions of dollars on EVs. GM is shutting down most of its EV production. Probably all of it soon. Not to mention the EVs in China are so badly constructed there have been hundreds if not thousands of batteries catching on fire. Talk about air pollution! Yes, fossil-fuel cars catch fire on occasion also. But EV fires are so bad and hot that a lot of parking garages have started to ban them because the fires happen so often and can cause structural damage.

Battery Electric Vehicles are not the answer, Hydrogen is. It would take 100 years to mine enough copper to replace the worlds ICE (internal combustion engine) fleet with battery EV's and only if we did not use a single pound of copper for anything else, like charging stations or power transmission lines. Only then would we have enough vehicles and only if most of the battery EV's stayed in service for at least 50 years and all the batteries (90 lbs of copper) also lasted 50 years, they actually last 12-15 years. The math is very simple, 187 lbs of copper per passenger car EV x 4 billion vehicles, this amount goes up drastically for larger vehicles of course. This does not even address the supplies of cobalt and Lithium used in Batteries and all the environmental destruction the mining would cause. If we had not tried the Battery Electric car, we could have already been building hydrogen fuel cell cars 80 lbs of copper average, no lithium or cobalt, building hydrogen stations and the technology to convert internal combustion engines in existing vehicles to Hydrogen already exists and is affordable at around $2,200 peer vehicle, less than current north American subsidies to buy Battery EV's. After reading this, the question is, why did we even try Battery EV's ? My answer is ...why does Elon Musk want to Own a social media company?

EVs are great if you (as a country) are capable to generate renewable energy in sufficient quantity to also cover the demand made by the EVs. 
If your country relies on burning coal to produce electricity and if you have the least amount of solar panels installed in the whole civilized world than, EVs are NOT GOING TO REDUCE Pollution... Yes, they might move the dirty air away from the city center to the outskirts but the total amount of pollution will increase since burning coal in an incredibly inefficient source of energy and the demand for it would increase...
Now, if you go nuclear that this problem will no longer exist.... however there is still the issue with the EV battery both in terms of production and disposal after (5 to 10) years... Battery manufacturing is, polluting as f. and is also energy demanding... But you'd say this is not our f-ing problem, let China deal with it... Well China might deal with it by not providing you with batteries or by increasing the cost... plus if you move pollution to China you don't deal with global warming you just shuffle the bullshit around .. 
The better option to EVs are hybrids... the hybrids combine the best of both worlds and they, generally require smaller batteries (which are easier and cheaper to produce).  If you pair this with home made energy production (via solar panels) you would get a total decrease in centralized energy production (thus a total reduction on the need of burning coal)  and you would get a far better deal on both fighting climate change and personal spending...

Let me guess Roof top Solar? most houses in Australia due to DuMB ASS fuckery, Force people to build homes with stupid designs like Black roofs because it matches every else's stupid Roof, really who gives a toss what colour peoples roofs are, but black roofs soak in HEAT, thus increasing people to use AIR CONDITIONING which uses Electricity, plus many peoples homes are facing the wrong way or have tree's in the way as well thus making Roof top Solar not Viable on top of that many homes do not even have the surface area to have a 25kw system yes solar is getting more and more power per panel ""500watts"" but still that's allot of power and guess what due to Air conditioning and Hot water and stoves all been electric in MOST area's 25KW is what many houses use plus all the other shit that runs on Electricity, add 2 cars 45kw each Full charge you have made a new shit show of Brown outs , black outs , $$$$$$$$$$$ expensive electricity.

You want more shit show added?

NBN Fixed WIFI you think that shit is not power hungry ????? transmitting any signal through AIR well guess what that's MegaWatt's of power just like your free to air TV, sure its not Centralized like TV or RADIO, but spread out but it still requires allot of power at the Receiving end your looking at 50 watts 24/7 that's like leaving an old Light globe on 24/7.

Fibre is just a tiny little light not even 1 watt including the transceiver. 

So the government cheaped out on the NBN with fixed WIFI cheap now, uses allot more power.

What to do with the EV BATTERIES they are made from Lithium ION breath that shit in, rub it on your skin and off to hospital you go, also if punctured or shorted out do not expect the FIRE DP to be able to put out the fire quickly as this is more then just a normal fire its a chemical reaction as well as an Electrical fire, all they can do is stop the fire from spreading and watch it go out, what about the TOXIC fumes ?

Please do your research instead of been tied to the GREENS Party.

Conclusion is an Electrical Engine more Efficient at converting Energy into Mechanical Energy YES.

Is the storage for Electrical Energy SAFE and environmentally friendly NO.

Is the storage for electrical Energy Efficient NO, when charging any battery you produce heat the amount of heat is waste energy. ""basically"" 

You say skilled people will be given work? NO, unless they work for TESLA, Most electric cars like your Apple devices can only be fixed by them and most of the time they say throw it away.
or they have put things in place like SN check and other checks and if it does not match even if its a genuine part it will not work until its updated by SOFTWARE that the TESLA/APPLE people only have so your fucked.

Can you fix the EVcar your self, Due to there propriety parts and due to the fact TESLA/APPLE only sell parts if they bother to there own supply or dealership making it hard to get most likely NO.

Tesla cars have many issues with Phantom Breaking, Phantom Acceleration , this is due to all of its controls are Electric meaning no cables or hydraulics plus they have input overrides by the computer enabling cool features like self DRIVE, While self drive will be great especially for those parents that pickup there high school kids and drive 40km all the way back home, we are not ready honestly I agree self driving cars will be great for certain things like Freeways and Highways as many idiots merge at 60km/h in 110km/h zone the software and technology is along way off.

Is Solar great yes i have solar my self but i know there are far better techs out there for GRID like Thermal SOLAR, Concentrated SOLAR which are cheaper options all you need is a plumber and steam turbines which all power plants have. ""except hydro as they use a different which i think is an impeller anyway designed to work at low speed and water""

Do i have enough Solar to power my 25kw house Fuck no, and i have my roof with solar ""on the side that it can get sunlight"" and solar in my fucking backyard and yet not making enough yet, Granted if replace my panels with the new ones 500watt panels i might hit that target, but when the fuck will it pay for it self off? Fuck knows because i will still get a bill anyway because batteries are expensive as FUCK.

EV's Batteries last between 5 to 10 years maybe more but at that point consider it lucky.

Australia is a LARGE SPARSE Country its not like the UK , Europe , ECT, many places have 500km distance hell Sydney shit hole is the largest would be one of the Largest cities in the world going on by AREA, EV's do not have the range yet.

Solution Hydrogen for cars and trucks is better alternative.

YES a car can pull an aircraft or a train which is heavier than an Aircraft but how much of its batteries did it DRAIN doing that? i would say allot as EVS do not break Physics.",none,,2023-12-02 21:55:16.057033,0.0

Bro really thinks charging an electric car with a gas generator at 85% efficiency is gonna save the planet üíÄ have you ever heard of critical thinking. I'll give you a short example. Houdini reportedly died of a punch to the stomach, but just based off my own personal common sense here's a few reasons why I'm skeptical:
1. Most humans don't have the strength to cause internal damage to the point of death via a punch to stomach.
2. If you had built your reputation on being able to take a punch to the stomach as hard as the tester could muster, you'd be very quick to clench the muscles in your stomach in order to absorb and dissipate the energy of a punch. 
3. Leading from clause 2: In order to surprise Houdini, you'd have to come from behind. However, unlike a punch to the head where you can come from any direction, to get a good punch to the stomach you'd have to come from the front. Assuming the reports are true and Houdini was in public at the time of the occurence, it's likely he would've been expecting this and would've been able to clench the muscles in his stomach and dissipate the energy.

1) for every 50 km outside the cities select &  give an opportunity for a single petrol pump to have one fast charging point.( Not more then one points because technology is changing & more faster charging ports will have adverse effect to change to new upgradation as the initial high investment is already done by multiple points ) selected petrol pumps will jump into a new opportunities as it will establish them ahead into the future against rivals.( If one is unwilling then select the next one . Make them impress with the govt major road sign board showing the power point as a destination all over the city . ) 
In fact it will be the important step to growth as overhead road sign show the way & distance to fast charging point from every direction just like chowks , Hospitals , bus stand , railway station.
2) select Dabas on outskirt of cities to have power point ( first single point on single selected daba, many as demand grow) . One faster charging for atleast one hour & they have a new kind of coustomers at their eatery , taking double profits from fast charging & their regular services  . A first power pointed Daba will establish itself as a prime location for the city.
3) make compulsory ( strictly ) for every car manufacturers to have atleast one entry level alternative battery operated cars in its lineup , like Tata Nexon ( but enty level is more affordable ) which have on par with oil power vehicle with added benifits of  electric power. 
Not those tiny under power but a full fledge & complete package.
 Without the multiple choice public will hesitate into being a first coustomers.
4) don't start as a national mission as all over nation in one go but as a one regional preference. Like Delhi & Mumbai  or metros & planned from inside out for 200 km , well established infrastructure for a metro city will pay the thousand folds head start for tier 2 or 3 cities.
5) reluctant in giving incentives or govt funding to fast charging points. It will have adverse effect on the over all market growth but rather give the opportunity for private market to lead the way ahead. It will start slow but will pace up faster &  sooner then we imagined.
Govt funding will make a good headstart but halt the further growth & after some time fail the overall market penetrations.
6) make a clearcut map to have charging points distributes evenly which spread to a long travel line & not in a clusters into one area ( multiple charging point will happen over time as demand grows but a long chain is very important . 
One single govt office is authorised to do the road map & will be responsible for the delay or miss planning .
7) make sure that a single power point is first placed,  restict making the  multiple point at one place in one go because it will dead lock the further growth & growth or demand is what the industry need. Too many charging point in one area will block the spread of an idea of battery power vehicle a viable option for outside of that area, & even battery vehicles of  that area will reluctant to go out of their areas . 
One single point will deversefied into multiple as the business growth ( rather multiple points in one area will have initial higher cost & newer business growth is unpredictable so a negative growth is seen for few years & then become a profitable. )",none,,2023-12-02 21:55:24.558930,0.0

Government has not made the proper use of heavy tax charged on petrol and diesel. That heavy tax must be used to provide pot hole free roads, speed breakers free roads, hawker and slum encroachment free roads, wide roads and clear roads not dug up for constructing ill-planned flyovers and metros. Tax must be used to provide 24 hours per day of electricity, internet and smartphone signal to each tax and bill paying resident of India. Need to travel can be minimized by doing most of the tasks online with the help of electricity, internet, mobile data, computers and smart phones. Central Government must help all the state electricity boards to recover arrears from those who have defaulted on payment of power bills and take strict action to stop theft of electricity. Government must support the indian people to maximize use of cycles for road travel like how Dutch people cycle in Netherlands. Indian people must use vehicle for road travel only when occupancy of that vehicle is at least 100% as it is wastage of fuel to find that 4-seater car is travelling on road with less than 4 passengers inside it. Meeting the fuel and basic needs demanded by approx. 139crores population of India is impossible and governments must strictly implement measures to control population. Providing electricity to each tax and light bill paying resident of India for running the refrigerator is more and most important than providing electricity to charge battery of EV. All the rain water in heavy rainfall activity areas must be captured and stored to provide to water-scarcity parts of India or to make hydroelectric power. Solar units must floated over water bodies instead of occupying land area & floating solar units will reduce evaporative loss of water from water bodies.

Lack of proper policy and lack of political will. The Governments, EESL and fleet buyers had not placed orders, they had not procured.

Misinformed and shortsighted Policy by, the CM AK,   Niti aayog and Government of Delhi.
Main concern by car buyers had been the  nonavailability of suitable affordable, dependable range of over 350kms in real driving conditions of electric vehicles, batteries,  parts, spare parts, lack of charging infrastructures and service centres. Shortages of skilled professionals. 
Nexon, Tigor has low- half range, not what ARAI mentions.

ELECTRICITY IS mainly PRODUCED BY USING FOSSIL FUELS. So not zero emission, long charging time too!

INDIA HAS  NO RESERVES/ NO PRODUCTION OF ESSENTIAL METALS FOR LI ION BATTERIES. All imported.
 
Also Tata Motors could not take advantage and failed to market properly its excellent products so far! They need techno marketing Specialist and professional brand ambassador. 
The Most important reason has been the successful adoption of cleaner, affordable,  reliable,  dependable,  well established Euro6/BS6 vehicles in India by all Stakeholders,  great initiative by Modiji!

Unlike US and the several other Nordic countries you mentioned, in India and China majority of electricity comes from burning coal. So you'll do more harm than good if you switch to EV. Not to mention that generally people use EV/hybrids much more generously than IC cars, because of this perception that it's slaving fossil fuels. We need to address these points first and move to a cleaner more sustainable source than coal before jumping to EVs.

1. Is the new policy applicable with immediate effect? OR If they are yet to release the GR

2. Will the MH gov transfer the subsidy to the owners account (as per earlier policy) OR If they will pass the subsidy to the OEM and the actual cost of the EV will be reduced? 

3. I‚Äôve also read that the interest rates on the EV‚Äôs will be lower then normal IR? 

4. As you mentioned, Nexon EV can avail the benefits since is 30kWh. However, the actual battery is 30.2kWh. Will it still be applicable to receive the benefit? 

5. Is the subsidy caped for upto ‚Çπ15 lakh car price? Like Gujarat? 

Could you please share the government website link of this policy. I see there is a google drive link in the comments. However, I needed a gov link to send it to sales guy.

The policy makes it seem that the middle class has loads of disposable income to buy new vehicles .In a country like India , if the vehicle is fit to run and meets the pollution norms , the middle class as always will be the worst sufferer and the already thin disposable income may be further dented . In the long run , people may not like to buy vehicles (due to high cost of ownership) but may focus on renting one  , thus affecting auto sales for whose benefit this policy seems to be tilted . Used car market may also be seriously affected . Coming to Electric Vehicles , do the Government really wants them to get popular as India is still highly dependent on the enormous tax on Petroleum products . Just because a vehicle is certain number of years old but otherwise fit on all norms , should it be scrapped or taxed more ? May good sense prevail .....",none,,2023-12-02 21:56:54.159345,2.0

So while I knew EVs were taking off over where you are there was this rather belated realisation of ‚Äòhang on, this actually looks manageable for a big country at an affordable price now‚Äô.

Fully Charged was sort of the starting point for getting me into EV and knowing how they worked _in general_ like focusing on bladder range and average daily use rather than ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs the vehicle with the longest range?‚Äô But it was when I started looking at more local stuff that I realised an EV was a thing that I would be able to buy _soon_ not in 5 or more years time despite our federal government‚Äôs insistence of being dragged kicking and screaming into reality by other countries banning new ICE sales by 2025-2030 etc.

So even though this channel and Fully Charged weren‚Äôt what made me realise ‚Äòoh I can actually afford this now‚Äô, they were what taught me what I needed to have a better idea of what to look for and what was actually available and just what the world was doing. Which is important in it‚Äôs own way. 

Plus purely and simply bringing hope that this transition is happening globally whether our federal government likes it or not, which is also a major plus, considering sometimes they can make you feel like things are hopeless, so seeing people‚Äôs thrill and excitement over EVs and them rolling out across the EU and overcoming hurdles is a massive bonus.",none,,2023-12-02 21:57:21.995930,0.0

You've stolen a lot of my thunder on a forthcoming rant of my own on inCARnation Australia. But great job. As you point out, a lot of states in Australia are trying to do good stuff with renewables and EVs, but they are being white-anted at the federal level. To know why, all you have to do is follow the money. $12 billion a year is collected in fuel and diesel excise. 42.7 per litre. And GST as well. What you didn't point out is that $10.3 billion of this gets funneled back to the mining and fuel companies. This happens many ways - tax concessions (often, no tax), building infrastructure for them from public funds - like railways, ports, offshore gas rigs, zero interest loans, heaps more). The fossil companies then of course spend a lot on PR and disinformation to keep those particular parties in power. Our political donation laws are very lax, so the real figure is many times what's disclosed. But the big donors on record are of course mining lobbies and the (mainly oversease) fuel companies - like Chevon (USA), Adani (India), Alinta (China). You scratch my back, I scratch yours. So the EV manufacturers have no incentive to bring their cars here and the losers are the Australian public, who don't get offered many new EVs, as Michael Bartch said in your excellent report. The really annoying other things is - although we dig a lot of stuff out of the ground - petrol and diesel is not helping our economy. Australia imports 90% of its refined fuel, mainly from Singapore but also from Africa, the Arab states and bizarrely from places like Korea and Japan. Our idiots in charge have their heads in the sand, and we Aussies are the big losers as a result. And the other guy is right - nobody here drinks Fosters - not since Barry McKenzie's days in the 1970s.

Our only options are either paying outrageous sums for new EVs or importing used ones from Japan. Australia no longer makes cars and is ideally placed to generate renewable energy, so what's to lose? A few federal seats in coal-mine country, that's what.

I think the most useful incentive would be to simplify EVs so that a basic one had zero techie frills - cars with all the gizmos and cameras and sensors and cruise control and self-parking gimmicks and stupid 'smart' driver aids and tyre-pressure monitors and heated seats and electric windows and central locking and gigantic entertainment screens and whatnot are loaded with such unnecessary added value extras to make their buyers feel even more special, and to maintain the 'aspirational' image of the product for oiks and scumbags like me who'll never be able to join the EV club.

Lithium battery technology is garbage because it's too fragile and demanding to be cost-effective, but until someone discovers a new, better battery system (100 years from now), manufacturers should concentrate on making a car with no more than a tolerably adequate battery with a decent service life. And nothing else.

A road-legal weatherproof buggy with a 200 mile range and 60mph top speed would be a good place to start. Spend just enough money developing it to stop it exploding when it's being charged overnight, and just sell the damn thing. No extras, no options, no choices, no luxuries.

Never mind safety, either - if you're too scared to go on the roads in a tiny tin can, walk. Market them like bicycles. Keep them simple. Just get people moving. No need for fast charging; if you want vast range, buy something else. No one's stopping you. These crud-buggies are supposed to be an alternative to what's currently on the market.

If batteries were cheaper you could carry a spare, but batteries are still rubbish, aren't they.

Still, pile those crud-buggies high and sell 'em cheap, I say.  Prices start at ¬£3,000 and end at ¬£3,000. Yep. ¬£3,000. No messing around.  A 21st century Wagen with volts for the Volks. Screw cachet, just get them on the roads.

Lose all the posh stuff; save 350kg, cut ¬£30,000 off the price, and build an EV for poor people. Go on, ya buggers - make it happen. That'll do some good and change opinions. We don't need another ludicrous, bloated SUV.

EV buyers are a cash-cow at the moment. Like Dyson vacuum cleaners, Stella Artois lager, and Apple products, EVs are reassuringly expensive. They're overpriced goods sold to comfortably-off people who've swallowed the line that 'they're worth it'.

You don't have to spend ¬£1,200 on an i-Phone; you can get a good-enough mobile for ¬£50 from Argos. But where's the EV equivalent? Where are the cheapo, crappy EVs?

They're in China.

So by making available really cheap, simple, basic EVs that cost 1/2 of a second-hand petrol equivalent, people would be falling over themselves to go electric. Yes, even in Australia. You'd own one just for the hell of it. Pottering around in a cheapo crud-buggy? That's a healthy habit to form.

Oh, I know it's fashionable to mock and hate China, but at least someone's trying to bring EVs to the masses. The west is still in love with size, power, performance, prestige, luxury, and automatic everything.

It's stupid, and is guaranteed to keep prices high and ensure that oh-so-smug Tesla owners continue to be viewed with contempt by infidels who don't see Ego Muskrat as the messiah. (""He's not the messiah - he's a very naughty boy..."")

Incidentally, talking of plebs and on the subject of names, my name's Eleanor. I wasn't named after the bassist in AC/DC,  I was named after Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was the queen of England in 1154 (my late mum was a historian). Too bad I wasn't named after Marie Antoinette - then, when people complained that they couldn't afford an EV, I could advise them to use one of their private helicopters instead.

2. Both of the two major political parties, but more so the LNP, like the donations they receive from the fossil fuel industry.

3. The fossil fuel industry employs a surprisingly small number of people in Australia. I say surprising because, thanks to media coverage and marketing, you‚Äôd think 99% of Australians were coal miners.

4. A few swing electorates do have coal mines in them.

5. The vast distances between major cities give people range anxiety even though, if they thought about it, everyone would realise they almost never, if not actually never, drive between them.

6. We are, on average, a pretty backward and ignorant people who also don‚Äôt engage our critical thinking faculties when it comes to voting.

Battery powered cars are probably the DUMBEST thing to happen in my lifetime, and I'm 62. Everybody seems to have this idea that battery powered toy cars (I think I got one for Christmas at around age 3) are such wonderful things. They are exactly the exact opposite, and anybody with any degree of intelligence knows that. They are super expensive to buy, super expensive to repair, have almost no range, they are totally impractical and they are drop dead boring. In other words, they are not desirable. I will never buy another new car, the last one I bought, a truck, was 29 years ago, and 3 engines and close to 800,000 miles later I still have it. I have a 700 hp 1964 (pre emissions ) home built hot rod/drag racer. I have 2 1980s Harley Davidson motorcycles. And last but not least, I also have a completely stock rebuilt from the ground up 1927 Ford Model T. I love all these vehicles. They are MACHINES. They push all the right buttons for me. They make me feel good. I totally loath and despise battery powered cars. Aside from their impracticality as transportation, they are also nothing more than appliances. They fit into the same category as microwaves and refrigerators. Here in the U.S. we love our cars. They are a lot more than transportation appliances (although even gas powered cars are headed in that direction) That's why I'm into vintage cars. I'm very passionate about them. There is no way anybody could be passionate about an oversize, overpriced golf cart. 

Everybody should be able to choose the car they want. That is a basic God given right. An inalienable right, as it says in the U.S. Constitution. Go0d bless the Australian government.

Even the government believes that EVs are never polluting. But actually the truth is that sometimes EVs are bad for the environment. Why? Because they can pollute when batteries get punctured/failed. Mining and extraction of lithium require a lot of toxic chemicals and fossil fuels (which is very bad for the environment). And battery production also requires a lot of fossil fuels. As EV batteries are much larger than batteries in ICE vehicles, manufacturing an EV produces more carbon footprint than manufacturing an ICE vehicle. And most of the electricity is generated by using fossil fuels. If the government bans combustion engine vehicles then more and more toxic chemicals and fossil fuels will be used to mine and extract lithium and produce batteries. So instead of going electric-only, companies should work on carbon-neutral synthetic fuels. Synthetic fuels are renewable fuels made from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. They are a great way to reduce air pollution from manufacturing, and to make ICEs sustainable and carbon-neutral. Unfortunately only a few automakers are working on synthetic fuels. And Porsche is one of them. In my frank opinion more and more automakers should work on synthetic fuels instead of switching to electric-only. THE TRUTH MUST BE EXPOSED AT ANY COST!!!",none,,2023-12-02 21:57:43.924384,0.0

The problem is the fact that we have localized plants, producing and then having to store and transport energy to other places that are very far away...when the real solution is in the way we create and produce appliances. Entropy is thought of in such a way, where once a system reaches equilibrium, it has used up ""all useful energy"" but this isn't true. In actuality, the system at equilibrium is operating at a maximally efficient rate.

Therefor what follows, is that appliances should themselves be like little batteries...powered by extremely local energy sources, which then distribute out their surpluses or taking in to cover deficits by other nearby neighbors appliances, until they balance themselves into equilibrium, like a balancing book. Then you no longer need to worry about storage, transportation or centralized hazards. 

Why do we know this is right? Because all life on Earth does this. Do plants have centralized power sources? No...each plant is capable of powering itself...and they distribute what they have in surplus to the rest of the bio-organism...and then eventually to other biomasses which is why we have lifeforms on earth today : Animals get their energy from plants that disperse the energy they receive from the sun. If you think about the Earth as one giant complex system, it's constant parts are taking the suns massive amounts of constant energy, and dispersing it more and more which is how it becomes more complex. If human civilization wishes to advance, fundamental physics, and the way we think about the world has to alter it's perspective away from the paradigm of ""more bigger more power."" 

Ironically...the atomic bomb...the biggest most destructive weapon ever invented...is a result of the tiniest of tiniest things, little atoms. and I mean, it's this same process that powers the sun too.

The true power of nature, lies in the fact that it's operating at these lower levels at such a massively efficient level, that it dwarfs the lack of efficiency that larger scale organisms like us haven't realized yet, is actually there.",none,,2023-12-02 21:57:46.600584,0.0

I dont know the specific numbers off the dome but green energy is FAR more mineral intensive than fossil fuels. It takes 15 wind turbines the size of the Washington monument to replace one 50-megawatt gas turbine. Demand for things like cobalt, llithium, manganese, rare earths, and plenty other minerals is going to exponentially increase. To meet supply it will take decades to map the necessary resources and build the mining infrastructure. Nuclear reactors, alternatively, can provide massive amounts of energy for comparatively low mineral cost in relation to wind and solar, but nuclear is unpopular in the West atm. Pure necessity might change that over time though. With the potential end of globalisation and the absurd amount of minerals needed to fuel a green economy, the net zero target by 2050 is probably a longshot.

The cheapest way of producing electricity is with a system of closed loop hydroelectric power stations combined with solar and wind power systems. Closed loop hydroelectric power stations can be built underground or incorporated into building design saving space and placing the power production closer to the point that the power is needed eliminating most substations and transformers. The longer the distance that electricity needs to travel the higher the voltage needs to be. Cities create constant wind currants and all you need is rooftop solar and wind power systems to recharge the closed loop hydroelectric power stations. Unfortunately electrical engineers are obsessed with large scale electrical systems which are not cost effective and are very inefficient. For the same costs as large wind and solar farms that can only power one city, closed loop hydroelectric power stations combined with rooftop wind and solar power systems can power several cities. In Adelaide south Australia the rooftop solar system on houses produce more than 3 times the electricity that can be used by the city and that is just the rooftop solar panels and doesn't include the wind farms, coal power stations and solar farms that produce more than 20 times the amount of power that is used during the day, the government spent millions on batteries that are very expensive and only have a maximum lifespan of 10 years. For the same price as the batteries they could have built a system of closed loop hydroelectric power stations strategically placed throughout the city that with proper maintenance last over 100 years. Closed loop hydroelectric power stations are very cheap batteries that only need water and gravity to store the electricity from solar and wind power systems. A closed loop hydroelectric power station is basically 2 water tanks a few turbines and generators and pumps, because they can be built by local companies the cost of manufacturing, matenance and transport are a lot cheaper than the large wind turbines that are commonly used. Electricity is very easy to produce and store but not using the old fashioned method of large scale electricity production in remote areas.",none,,2023-12-02 21:57:47.407381,0.0

The largest known reserves of cobalt are located in the Democratic-Republic of Congo where child labor is used to extract this raw resource. Cobalt is used to create batteries for electric cars, laptops/Chromebooks, smartphones, etc. and people want the resource to be cheap so the final product can be cheaper. To broadly summarize, well-developed countries greatly benefit from the child labor involved in return for cheaper cobalt. This can be found where there is an ongoing lawsuit against Apple, Dell, Google, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla Motors because of them benefiting off child labor in the Democratic-Republic of Congo. I certainly do not know the involvement each company has, but it is naive to think that everyone does not benefit from this child labor, ultimately making our smartphones, laptops, etc. cheaper for every day consumers. I am not condoning child labor, but just stating that this is an issue. If this was something within a well developed country there would be outrage, but because it is happening elsewhere and people do not have to deal with the ramifications, or simply hear about the problem because they simply do not care or it is because people are uninformed. Regardless, people living within well-developed countries benefit from others suffering from child labor because they are consumers receiving a cheaper product. Broadly speaking, will the average person really embrace higher costs of every day products? The answer is likely ""no."" Because people are not informed on this or simply lack the empathy to be concerned about child labor fueling the cobalt supply chain is what will likely extend child labor within the cobalt industry. I cannot help but refer to the relevance of ""ignorance is bliss"" on this issue.

First, solar and wind is not clean energy! It‚Äôs still base of finite resources that are not ‚Äúrenewable/clean‚Äù as well it‚Äôs not efficient enough to have a radical change of energy source to change to. Especially that can produce the same amount with how much we consume, especially with the amount of electricity we will be consuming in the near future. 

Second, like a healthy ecosystem there‚Äôs i diversity of life that helps the biology within the ecosystem. Us humans can‚Äôt heavily rely on specific sources of energy. (Even though we do it for profit and greed) We need a diversity sources of energy to balance out  our resources and consumption. 

Third. The infrastructure is by far the most important part and the key to living in clean sustainable society. However a much more efficient and effective grid system/infrastructure is having area that can produce enough energy for that specific area that can equal the consumption of that area. Ultimately we can‚Äôt have a massive complex web grid system going everywhere. Now we already have that but its very costly, causes more issues that require more management and uses alot more finite resources. That‚Äôs not sustainable for the future, as well with maintenance, and etc. to simplify it, building a sky scraper is a lot more complex than to build a house. Micro managing the grid is way more efficient and would use less energy in the long hall than to use a complicated web grid system to transport electricity around the globe. 

Sad to say we will never have a clean sustainable city, as long as our lifestyle is the same. We must change the way we live and construct everything in order to balance our artificial human ecosystems with the nature. We can‚Äôt just consume everything or have an extravagant lifestyle. That takes the resources away from future generations. Still to this day we are extremely primitive and egotistic. To truly change for the better good of nature and humans. We our self must evolve first before we can supposedly change to become more ‚Äúclean, healthier and sustainable.‚Äù Paradise or a utopia will never exist if we can come in peace and balance with ourselves and nature.

Just one thing which made me to select petrol powered bike was RANGE.

I am a guy who takes bike more than 350 kms in single strech at every alternate weekend, so the EV option was simply scraped.

I think if govt. wants to promote EV, they should work on Charging station at every fuel pump currently operational and promoting technologies to quick charge the EV.

Subsidies won't attract the bikers as easily as the infrastructure for recharging.

If you want to buy normal 150 CC bike and cost is Rs 1,30,00 (OR) and EV's price is Rs. 1,50,000 (Without Subsidies) and if there is infrastructure and technology that can charge you vehicle say in 30-40 mins upto a range of atleast 100 KMS then nobody will mind paying extra 20,000 because do the math you will eventually save that 20,000 in just 1 year of purchase.

because running Petrol powered bike will not only consume petrol 
but, in 1 year it will consume
Rs. 1500 of engine oil (Non synthetic)
Rs. 2000 on maintaining chain

And other consumables which EV doesn't require.

So the conclusion, spend on Infrastructure and technologies not subsidies.",none,,2023-12-02 21:57:48.690661,0.0

1. Companies like Ather can sell charging docks to common people or Shopkeepers. People/Shopkeepers can install these charging docks outside their house/Shop (one or two according to the space available).
Then there will be no problem about availability of charging stations. EV owners can find charging docks at highway Dhabas also.
Now, what about payment system - Payment can be done through UPI or any other mode, the charging will start after payment will be completed.

2. Charging docks can also be installed in petrol pumps where petrol pump owners will keep some space for EVs charging area.

TESTIMONIALS:
Elizabeth from England, UK
I cannot say thank you enough for your assistance in fixing our marriage. Fighting is a thing of the past and we are closer than we used to be. You are blessed and amazing.

J Roberts of New York
My offer to fly you to New York still stands. It‚Äôs the least I can do for your help and support. I still cannot believe you took me out of depression when medication failed.

Above all, you returned my hobby from that snatcher. I am forever indebted to you. Please let me know when you are ready to travel and its all on me.

Alessandro from Milan, Italy
She said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, wedding date out soon! Please come and celebrate with us. We are because of you. I could not hide it from her that you made it happen and she is dying to meet you.

- E Vehicles Are Not Maintenance Free. Transmission, Suspension, Underbody, Safety Braking Are Needed To Be Serviced Periodically.

- Lithium Mining Itself Is A Water Polluting Process. Check Serbian Mining Industry Videos.

- For Charging Those Vehicles, Our Power (Electricity) Requirements Will Increase. To Generate That Much Electricity Again, We Will Use ""Coal"" Or Any Other Conventional Fuel.

They're not going sell us a car that will last a long time and be cheap to operate and maintain. There's no profit in that. They're going to find a way to make electric vehicles at least as profitable as ICE vehicles, whether it be through expensive batteries or subscription services or tying consumers into a certain software ecosystem, etc. Whatever it is, there is no way EVs can be more economical for consumers than ICE vehicles because corporations can't tolerate a loss of profits.

Lets make this clear that is WHY  GMH and Ford pulled out of Australia as car manufactures.
So again to make that very Clear,  these mega companies are holding the government to ransom!  
So tell me why did the Australian Government and State Governments not give me mega money when I had a business?   Why is it I paid tax on stock?  Even when it has been taxed the year before?   
You see Business that is small has to make it's own way. Your business your profit your loss.  
But these Mega Companies want it all.  The top end taking Millions in salaries and perks,  put huge mark ups on their goods, then want to be subsidised by WHO, the Tax payer!   Which includes all the other businesses that are small fry..  
I am sick of the bull dust around electric vehicles. 1, You have to pay for a charging station at home as many of these vehicles need a slow charge.  2, That charge station has requirements that your home  and area (especially here in Australia)  is unlikely to have to even more cost.  Metres, 100amp Fuses.  Correct cable to take the power loading.  The street power line must also be up to the new power loading of so many cars drawing large amp loading.  Then  how many cars do you have ?   Because it is very unlikely you will be charging more than one at a time.   
So the Car cost more!  The power prices are going up!  The Batteries are just, Rechargeable Lithium Ion the same as you buy at Coles or Woolies.  So life span under high strain use,  Deep cycle!   Your home batteries are for trickle loads.  How much are these batteries to buy?  Because they will not last just as any battery.
So I am a pensioner.  I can't buy a new car!  I can't pay for all the conversions at home.  
Lets face it power supply where I am is weak at best.   I can't even get a decent internet connection.  Seriously I can't.    So what about the whole new Power line net work we are going to need???  Is that a guess on my part... No!   BUT DON'T ASK ME ASK A POWER LINE ENGINEER.  SOMEONE HONEST THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN INTEREST EG; MONEY!   Unlike your mate here that has only a very big business interest. Did I mention I have worked, in Europe as a railway Signal and Telecommunications lines man.
Very aware of power supplies and sections.  
O.K  On a better Note! due to better electronic/ computer controls.   Old designs of electrical motors are now being able to be made. ( Tesla the real,  ( Mr Nikoli Tesla brilliant man)  ) and others had designs that they could not make due to the lack of technology.   These engines are small and compact but put out power and revolutions.    
The outline I have spoken of are real and serious issues.  Like so much that is going on in todays world details are the thing that are Glossed over.  Yet it is always the detail that kills.  
Todays Batteries are not good enough YET!  use hours and or Distance are very best results Not actual. 
Plus battery life and replacement costs.  Temperature effects batteries, cold discharges batteries. 
High temperatures can also damage the battery, the sort of temperature we get here in parts of Australia. 
Here in Queensland   40-50C is in a normal summer,  In a closed vehicle as we know (Kids and pets in cars) it can reach 90C
Electric cars in town and near suburbs.  But to cross Australia,  I have driven to Canberra and Cairns,  Brisbane to Charleville and Quilpie  10 hours straight drive to Charleville all for work. Company car petrol and even then you had to be sure to carry a full tank of fuel keeping the car full.   There is a lot of nothing out there.  Break down and you have a real problem.  A stone punched a fuel fuel tank once I only just made it to the next town. Where I stayed for three days till a new fuel tank arrived.  
There is no way that electric vehicles can be useful in country Australia. It is larger than all Europe and connecting seas. 
You all are going to wreck the future of Australia for a CO2 % lees than 1 %.   
Labor and LNP  CO2 climate Change is false.   You are being lied to.  Why?   Just like the Common Market.  There is a plan of take over.  You will sign up to one thing then another then the trap. 
The trap is Control.   Just look at the E.U. !     
Labor and LNP need to read and believe what I have written here.   Read it and think deeply.  Get in philosophers work out the the paths.  
Both political parties need to come together and really look at watch all this means to Australia.  
Don't sign, just do. Build reactors for power.  Reduce without commitment to a piece of paper. The Paper is the trap.  They can not complain if we achieve.  Unless they show they are after control..",none,,2023-12-02 21:58:42.388521,0.0

Who is going to loan a $75k EV to a pensioner? IDK.

There are Chinese EV‚Äôs coming soon, but I haven‚Äôt seen pricing yet. The better option would likely be for the government to get some guarantees from the Dealers and Manufacturers locally so there‚Äôs no shenanigans with plate swapping or fleet deals taking advantage of income capped subsidies, sic.

Something to bring EV‚Äôs down from $45k MG ZS to $65k Model 3, or above‚Ä¶ to the $30k range for affordability, but also avoid people reselling or auctioning the car within 2-5 years to taxi companies or fleets.

The next problem is perhaps maintaining, road levies, registration, insurance and aftermarket repair, especially if you are selling $70k cars to people who can‚Äôt afford the replacement or insurance burden, sic.

There are 10 year loans and repayment plans in Europe, which might be an option if it‚Äôs backed by a state government subsidy. 

The next issue is having a dealer agreement to support the car for 10 years to get the subsidy, which should be a kick in the teeth for Hyundai or Toyota, MG or Mercedes Benz, but probably not a significant deterrent in an early market where the uptake is limited, and agreeing to service a car for any fault over 10 years is a good faith agreement for people scared about batteries falling to dust, or needing to be towed to the scrap yard after 9 years and 11 months. 

$8k/year might put it in the realm of affordable for middle income people, but it also creates a lot of debt if the car gets wrecked in the interim, a problem that a state-secured long term loan is going to have to address too. 

Another option could be a buy-back/recycling of 20 year old cars prior to 2002, sic. 

I would say that $25k towards a $75k loan from the state gov would be nearly outright ignored, because if $25k is a problem, $50k is so much more difficult to find for the kind of people the loan would need to be designed for, ie to ‚Äúimprove the safety of the roads‚Äù, sic.",none,,2023-12-02 21:58:42.388911,2.0

1. Anybody is going to wait 2 hours (in best case with a supercharger) to have the battery charged
2. A individual network of charger (every owner with his own charger) is completely unsustainable and impossible. Think about big cities and the number of cars that there are in them. Where would they be installed? 
3. Normal people can not afford pay for a new battery or a new vehicle every 8 or 10 years because the battery capacity. However battery swapping not only eliminate this problem but also allows owners to have always last battery technologies and choose the most convenient capacity according to their needs (for example choose a small battery for daily use in case they don't need to do a long distant travel)

The advantages are clear for users:
1. Not owning a battery is not worry about the state, deterioration or charge of them.

However. If you just standardized an interface for a battery trailer then rentals of battery trailers with trailer swaps at gas stations and rest stops would work and indeed both Germany and France have companies that do this albeit with proprietary connectors and only on high use corridors.  Battery trailer rentals would require far less equipment for each swap site and could be large enough to not require enroute swap sites and only have them at destinations such as at car rental locations or dealerships.   For the US, it may be best to rent generator extensiin trailers to leverage the existing gasoline and diesel infrastructure and only offer the rentals from a few sites again such as car rental offices and dealerships especially as fast charge corridors already exist in high use areas hence trailer rentals may be a temporary requirement for long trips as hooking up and pulling a trailer is also an inconvenience and many would still prefer making a bathroom and coffee break every hundred miles instead.

As to fast chargers, EV's should arrange their batteries in banks, at least two banks, a primary and a reserve.  As batteries charge the quickest when depleted, for a long trip you would want to deplete the primary battery and only partially charge it to reach the next recharge site but this leaves you with very little reserve, however having two banks means you can deplete the primary and still have the secondary to search for a recharge site with.  It's like how some trucks have two fuel tanks.  The two bank concept will allow you to deplete one bank for the quickest partial recharge possible rather than trading your reserve for that fast charge.",none,,2023-12-02 21:59:04.311289,0.0

To beat gas, we can explore cheap green liquid ammonia that powers fuel cells, which produces electricity, which turns motors, which turns wheels. And we can also explore standardized swappable low-range cheap plug-in EV batteries that use fewer rare earth materials.
Liquid ammonia has three big challenges: (a) it consumes three times more volume relative to gasoline per unit energy, (b) it needs to be chilled to -32¬∞C, and (c) ammonia vapor needs to be kept out of noses. To maintain refrigeration, ammonia-based vehicles would need to maintain constant communication with a central authority, and if refrigeration failed, a service vehicle would need to visit to either repair or remove ammonia. A plug-in swappable standard refrigeration hardware unit used by all vehicles might make automated replacement easier. A refrigeration maintenance system would ultimately add to the total cost of ownership. 
The good news is that liquid ammonia fuel made with Generation 4 should be cheaper than gasoline, per unit energy. And a fuel cell's 50% efficiency is better than an internal combustion engine's 25% efficiency. Also, one can explore combusting hydrogen, as explained in this video. In summary, if engineers can get the total cost of ownership for an ammonia-based car to be less than a gasoline-based car, it might be viable.
Currently, proprietary batteries are installed in each EV car and are periodically charged. Alternatively, one could have a standard plug-in battery, where all cars use the same form, and are swapped with a fresh battery in less than 60 seconds. Car owners would pay for the energy consumed and wear on the battery. Cavities would be dug out at key locations and a mechanism would be dropped in via crane that implements charging, storage and swap. Cars would position themselves over the mechanism, and the swap would occur automatically. Swap mechanisms might be positioned next to highway on/off ramps, and next to frequented establishments. For example, the corner next to your local drug store might be convenient. If swap is easy and fast, then shorter range batteries would become more acceptable; and these tend to be cheaper and use fewer rare earth materials.
Installing swap chambers or liquid ammonia refueling infrastructure would be an enormous undertaking. 
Currently, gov't observes that EV battery prices have dropped over the past few years, extrapolates forward, and declares this as the transportation decarbonization plan. However, this might not work due to rare earth constraints. Subsequently, we should consider investing heavily in transportation that is cheaper than gas and is not resource constrained. For example, gov't could invest $10M/yr over 3 years for each of the following R&D initiatives:
‚Ä¢	Design swappable plug-in battery infrastructure. 
‚Ä¢	Design ammonia-based car.
‚Ä¢	Design an automated ammonia refueling station.
‚Ä¢	Design a standardized plug-in ammonia refrigeration unit & tank.
‚Ä¢	Design an automated city-wide ammonia refrigeration monitoring and maintenance system.
In summary, engineers need to figure out how to build 2,500,000 cheap green cars over ~25 years.",none,,2023-12-02 21:59:04.311397,0.0

Batteries lasts more than 1 million miles today even with fast charging (as long as thermal management is working). Here the batteries in the car has no thermal management and hence the life of these batteries I think will be shorter even with slow charging. Also (current) lithium batteries should not be charged much above 80-90% and left unused for a long time. Here they are probably charged to 100% and left until next car needs it... 10 minutes change time must come down as fast charging is quickly getting down to this level.

There's a reason why Tesla never followed through on it. On most EVs, the battery is the single largest, heaviest, most expensive, most dangerous component. It should be sealed tight, rigidly fixed in place, shielded, and protected as much as possible from the external environment to reduce the chance of puncture or other damage.

Battery swapping requires quick and easy access through the bottom of the car. This is a TERRIBLE idea because it creates so many opportunities for the battery to be scratched, scraped, dinged, dropped. The bolts, screws, guide rails and all other parts on the undercarriage will also be exposed to wear and tear over time as well as potential damage from a careless battery swap. Perhaps a small part that holds the battery in place is now slightly bent but not enough for anyone to notice until it's too late. It won't be long before we see news stories about car batteries that just *plop* fall out of the car on the highway or in city traffic after hitting a pothole. I can already picture a battery falling out of a speeding car, scraping the ground, sparks flying, flipping end over end, suffering even more damage from the multi-car pileup, and finally bursting into flames. This is a disaster waiting to happen. 

There's also the issue of quality control. When you're constantly swapping in a different battery, you have no idea how old it is, nor how it's been handled (or mishandled) in the past. Was it always stored and charged properly? Was it previously damaged but not severely enough to be sent back to the manufacturer and instead shoved back into inventory? The more battery swapping is scaled up, the more the quality control issues will pile up. The problems will grow exponentially.",none,,2023-12-02 21:59:04.616268,0.0

And leaving aside those tech issues, I have serious doubts about the financial viability. Batteries are very expensive. At the scale they are working at, they have to be spending somewhere around $200 per kWh at the module level. That's $10,000 worth of batteries for each 50 kWh swap. If you assume 4 cars per hour, and a charge time of 8 hours before you can re-deploy a battery, you need 32 cars worth of batteries, $320,000. At 10 cents per mile, that implies a swap will cost about $20 to the driver. The power in the battery will cost the swap station at least $10. Leaving aside all the other costs of running the station, at $10 profit per swap, They will need 1000 swaps just to pay for the battery.",none,,2023-12-02 21:59:04.617240,0.0

It seems more of marketing. Main reason ppl excited about swap 1. Can ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù their battery any time. 2. Get a full charge like gas station time-wise.

For 1, actually it is not not too difficult to upgrade your battery even without swap. The only useful case is you can rent a bigger battery occasionally while rest of time rent a smaller pack so ideally you may ‚Äúsave‚Äù some money if you are not driving a lot. Otherwise it should be a regular maintenance job to replace your battery for cars does not support swap (unless they are horribly designed).

For 2, it only works if swap station can scale like gas, I mean not only number of station wise, but also pumps per station wise. Swap requires level of automation far more advanced than gas pumps and makes it much more expensive to have swap slots vs pumps per gas pool. If you go to a station it has 1 or 2 swap slots, each takes 5 mins (2-3 mins for swap and rest for park in drive out). It easier gets more than 15 mins with 10 cars ahead of you. Not mentioning max batteries per station and the maintenance of them. Fast charge station on the other hand, feels to me much easier to built and maintained. And delivers a 15 mins full charge is promising with potentials for less.

The drawback of swaps is now your car has to be limited design to support battery swap, so it may not be optimized towards max capacity/load balance/economics. Plus, All new models have such limitations. It is very large overhead on rolling out new models.",none,,2023-12-02 21:59:05.333001,0.0

After watching your explanation, I now know that the $5K penalty for not being able to wait, won‚Äôt actually be wasted - since it‚Äôs likely to be saved in the (very) long run by avoiding the usage charge.

Although as you quite rightly say, things can change - the govt could interpret things differently, or it could even overhaul its policy at any time.

First world problems with these decisions. What I do know for certain, is that within 24 hours after me taking delivery, Tesla will then announce changes which will include a head-up display and active suspension, as well as a price drop‚Ä¶ üòÇ",none,,2023-12-02 21:59:11.293424,1.0

Even if the whole country's electricity is produced through coal, which is not the case here in Pakistan, (we majorly depend upon hydro-power) still it will be much much better than using these fuel engines which release a lot of harmful gases and heat! These are the major cause of Smog and temperature rise! 
In thermal (Coal based) power plants, before releasing any gas in environment, these gases are filtered out (its compulsory for every industry as per our country's law). Also the heat generation is only in small area(power plant site) which is usually outer parts of cities having less population. Also a lot of hydro power dams are under construction which will be in working condition within 3-5 years.
In short EVs will definitely reduce pollution and temperature rise in Pakistan!",none,,2023-12-02 21:59:15.834261,7.0

1.  Do we have Lithium or cobalt for batteries for these Electric vehicles.. We import them ...right. And can we compete with China  LI-ion battery manufacturing with their huge reserves of Lithium and presently leading the World production and export of Li-ion batteries
2.  What about the generation of electricity to charge these batteries? We are using coal, which defeats the entire purpose. Going electric in the vehicle segment but using polluting fossil fuels to produce the electricity to charge so many EVs is overall counterproductive.
3. That brings us to cleaner energy production. So thinking of Nuclear plants. Only 3% of our electricity need is met by our 21 functional Nuclear power plants. Reasons are import dependency for fuel grade Uranium. We have reserves of Thorium-rich Monazite. But Thorium can not be used in a reactor directly for power production. It has to undergo an expensive nuclear treatment to convert it into Uranium-233 a radioactive isotope. Is it clean ?... Well not exactly. Security risks and toxic residues like U-232 (half life -1,60,000 years), Technetium-99 (half life 300,000 years) and Iodine-129 (half life of 15.7 million years) are definitely not good for you when it will seeps in to your water table however deep you hide it.
4. What are we left with...Solar and wind...With the existing technology the scales required can not be met.
5.  Alternative methods like Batteries which do not need recharge? Like Hydrogen fuel cell? Well it is efficient, it is zero emission, byproducts are just heat and water which is not toxic(used by astronauts as drinking water....yes Im not joking) and its the most abundant element on earth. But cons are(a)  hydrogen extraction requires energy....(b) some metals used are Platinum(costlier than gold)  (c)  highly combustible and risk of 350 Volts electric shock////Yiiikes.
6.  Dont hold your breath but alternative battery chemistry with very high energy density and none of the cons listed above may be the answer if rapid adoption and end-use case is needed.
7.  Last but not least...where are we going to dump so many IC engines.
8. Not to sound discouraging but just a different perspective. Energy production has to be environmentally clean...and our lifestyle must change  to reduce carbon footprint....no two ways about that ....but will technology help and how much time will it take? So as Akshat clearly warned you in the beginning...Invest but not all your eggs in one basket...Thanks",none,,2023-12-02 21:59:47.215207,0.0

However...I'm concerned about few of the points in your videos, especially while covering topics related to companies in core engineering & technology domain. One key observation that you tend to overlook, is related to corporate governance issues and the other is about the ability of the companies to invest in R&D, which is particularly true incase of battery manufacturers. Please keep in mind that the lithium-ion battery technology isn't the end game in battery technology, since there are multiple areas of research in battery technology currently like aluminium-air and few others. Battery manufacturing is prone to more disruption in the future. While, I concur with your assesment on Hero Motor corp but I'm afraid you haven't got a full picture on a leading battery manufacturer, which you seem very optimistic about.

However, I'm still doubtful about going all-in on this market because I have a hunch that the growth is overestimated. I'll explain my logic, please correct me if I'm wrong.

Unlike other sectors, EV is set to REPLACE the existing IC engine automobiles and not CREATE a new buyer segment. If I have an IC-based car today, I would never go and buy an EV on top of it. Instead of creating a new blue ocean market altogether, it's going to share the pie with the existing automobiles sales market. So IC-based automobile sales will decrease and EV sales will increase. In the coming years, doesn't this translate to all OEMs adjusting their portfolio of manufactured vehicle parts? They will reduce IC-based parts and increase EV parts in their portfolio. For the OEMs, the revenue from IC parts will reduce, EV parts will increase, and balance out each other. So when we see the EV sales numbers, %growth will be through the roof, but the actual ROI on vehicle manufacturer stock investments in India will still see only slightly accelerated growth. To sum up, there is definitely growth potential in the EV market, but maybe it's being overestimated. The assumption being, EV is not a new market like the world perceives it. It's a replacement for an existing one. Investing in companies such as Tesla would give massive returns, but the OEMs, maybe not as much.",none,,2023-12-02 21:59:47.816819,6.0

Because the average motor vehicle in the US is about 12 yo this year, up from 11+ yo in 2020, the average citizen may fairly quickly figure out that if they don't buy a BEV for their next vehicle that a substantial investment in an ICE vehicle anytime starting now will be worth next to nothing by the time they sell or trade-in to buy another one in the future.

This will help drive adoption. As adoption of BEVs rises the supporting infrastructure for ICE vehicles will deteriorate. New filling stations will not be added due to flagging needs and because additional cost for expensive fuel holding tanks will add to that equation. I expect a tipping point will be reached where finding expensive petrol/gasoline/diesel and BEV adoption will quickly flip to 99% of new cars. Just a few specialized ICE vehicles continue for another decade or two.The adoption of BEVs will further be supported by the increased governmental investment in sustainable energy infrastructure. However‚Ä¶there is vast investment in old technology that will mitigate the changeover. Most of that is aging and has an increased cost to maintain. But taking all that into consideration makes it difficult to set time lines. It seems to be happening increasingly quickly though and much of the world is looking to see it happen between 2030 and 2050. That seems about right. New vehicles flip to 90-95% BEV by 2030 worldwide and that would be a vast improvement to our environment. 2025-2026 BEV production should reach 5-10 million units worldwide and the flip should begin shortly afterward.,none,,2023-12-02 21:59:53.758015,0.0

The strategy needs to be reimplement because the age of the vehicle cannot determine the how badly it's affecting the environment but the health of the engine. The more you use the vehicle the more it will pollute.
Commercial vehicles fits perfectly in this policy because there is more wear and tear but for personal use vehicle it doesn't make sense at all.
And let me add up few more points.
1. Scrapping and reproducing new vehicle will pollute the environment even more.
2. They say EV doesn't pollute, well production of battery emits Hugh amount of carbon emission.
3. Not every individual will be able to afford new vehicle.
4. Lot of corruption will happen in RTO's.
5. Speaking of employment? When there is no more frequent wear and tear, then how can u expect local mechanic to survive ? 
Everything thing will come at a cost which is really not worth it right now.

Pvt cos are known for settling small claim very swiftly and are notorious for denying (on any flimsy grounds) or under-settling big claims. So they can easily maintain good claim settlement ratio despite having far lesser amount settlement ratio.
PSUs have backing of govt and claim settlement is transparent and generous irrespective of the claim amount. They simple reason is: they have to strictly follow IRDAI guidelines and PSUs have social service as priority not brute profits. And now a days they match or even exceed the TAT( turn around time) compared to PVT companies. If you check the no of complaints against insurers in website of Ombudsman, Beema lokpal or IRDAI, private companies top the disgraceful list and govt companies are least tarnished.
Now,the question arises why dealers or online portals / web aggregators don't prefer PSUs
1) Huge commission paid by Pvt cos to dealers and online web aggregators. So, they sideline PSU insurers and charge hefty premiums from unsuspecting customers so that they can enjoy mammoth share of your premium as commission, totally flouting IRDAI rules.
2) The dealers and web aggregators have to scrupulously comply with IRDAI guidelines while dealing with PSU insurers which will reduce any foul play or   unfair practices which are meant for safeguarding customers against any fraud. Remember,if your claim is stuck by dealer or Pvt cos,you are nowhere to go but in govt companies, strict compliance saves any injustice. So dealers want monopoly in their hands not yours.
Thus, you can draw the inference as to why PSU insurers should the only choice while buying insurance for your loved vehicle.
The 4 renowned PSU/ Govt insurance companies are
1) UNITED INDIA INSURANCE CO. LTD
2) NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD.
3) NATIONAL INSURANCE CO. LTD.
4) ORIENTAL INSURANCE CO. LTD.
So, next time you buy a new vehicle,never purchase insurance from dealer instead approach PSU office and get cover for your vehicle. And whenever you renew your cover, do the same .

I strongly feel we should NOT buy Personal accident insurance cover alongwith the Motor insurance policy.
1. The accident insurance cover is only applicable for the owner of the vehicle. So if any of your family member meets accident with your vehicle they would get nothing in cover.
2. Limit is only 15 Lakhs.
3. it will only cover accidental damage while driving that insured vehicle only.

So its far better that you buy a separate Personal accidental insurance cover as
1. It will cover accident due to any reason not just while riding the vehicle.
2. Cover will be far bigger amount.
3. You can take floater plan with your family members.",none,,2023-12-02 22:00:34.745360,2.0

I practiced the Asian food question, and there is a difference in  my note from yours. Perhaps the food pricing in the issue tree might be altered to reflect the average amount paid per customer/order? Then you may further divide it into item prices and number of items ordered. As you mentioned, it's difficult to increase the price of items, but the quantity of items is something the owner may experiment with (e.g. encourage customers to order more each time).",none,,2023-12-02 22:00:55.187542,2.0

- Are McKinsey case interviews always interviewer-led? And is the structure more or less always a) general context problem solving question; b) analytical part with exhibit, c) ""creative"" solution and final recommendation?
- Is the case interview different (i.e. level of difficulty) for a business analyst and a junior consultant / junior associate?

So, if the rupee takes a nosedive, it's the investor who gets the spicy surprise!

These bonds are like a Bollywood drama, featuring both government and private entities. Foreign investors outside India can partake, as long as they're from countries that play by financial rules. The benefits? High-interest rates, a boost of confidence in the Indian economy, and even tax exemptions on capital gains in rupees.

What makes them special is that these bonds are written in Indian Rupees but can be bought and sold in foreign currencies, like the US dollar or the euro.

Here's why they're useful:

1. More Money Sources: Indian companies can use masala bonds to get money from international investors, not just within India. It's like getting money from people all around the world.

2. Less Money Risk: Since masala bonds are in Indian Rupees, Indian companies don't have to worry about the value of other currencies going up and down. This makes it safer for them to borrow money internationally.

3. Global Investments: People from other countries can invest in India without dealing with Indian Rupees directly. They can invest in these bonds and get a slice of the Indian economy.

4. Boosting the Rupee: Masala bonds help make the Indian Rupee more important in international money dealings, kind of like how the US dollar is used worldwide.

5. Building Things: The money raised from masala bonds is often used to build important things in India, like new energy projects or roads.

6. More Choices for Investors: For investors, it's a way to spread their money around and not have all their investments in one place.

However, there are some risks, like changes in exchange rates or the possibility that the company might not pay back the money. So, while masala bonds can be very useful, they're not without risks, and both the companies and the people investing in these bonds need to be careful.",none,,2023-12-02 22:01:15.104403,0.0

Currency Risk Mitigation: Issuing in rupees can help Indian issuers avoid currency risk, as they don't have to convert the funds into foreign currency.

Access to Global Markets: Provides access to a wider pool of international investors and a broader capital base.

Attracting Foreign Investment: Attracts foreign investors to India's debt market, fostering economic growth.

Financial Inclusion: Can promote inclusion by bringing in a more diverse set of investors into the Indian financial system.

Interest Rate Arbitrage: May provide cost-effective financing compared to domestic interest rates.

The term ""masala"" refers to the spiciness of Indian cuisine and is used metaphorically to imply the Indian flavor of these bonds. Masala bonds allow Indian entities to raise funds from international investors, thereby accessing a wider pool of capital.

Masala bonds are typically issued by corporations, financial institutions, or international organizations seeking to finance infrastructure projects, corporate expansion, or other investment opportunities in India. These bonds are settled in Indian rupees, which means that the issuer bears the exchange rate risk, unlike dollar-denominated bonds where investors bear the risk.

The introduction of masala bonds in 2015 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was part of a broader effort to attract foreign investment and deepen the Indian capital market. They provide an alternative fundraising avenue for Indian entities, particularly those involved in sectors like infrastructure and manufacturing.

Investing in masala bonds can be attractive for international investors as it allows them to gain exposure to Indian markets and diversify their portfolio. However, they also come with risks, including currency exchange rate fluctuations and the creditworthiness of the issuing entity.

Masala bonds have contributed to the growth of India's bond market and have been well-received by investors. They offer an innovative financing option, promote internationalization of the Indian rupee, and facilitate capital flows into the country.",none,,2023-12-02 22:01:15.104957,0.0

They are a form of debt financing (raising money via debt) used by foreign entities to raise funds in Indian rupees from Indian investors. These are called 'Masala' Bonds because of the various spices used in our country. 
The main utility of these bonds is that they provide a new way of financing for establishing foreign entities' base in India while giving an attractive investment opportunity to Indians.
1. These allow foreign entities to tap into the debt market of India which is one the largest in the world
2. For foreign entities, issuing bonds denominated in Indian rupees can help them manage currency risks. By issuing bonds in rupees, they can avoid the currency risk associated with borrowing in a foreign currency and then converting it back to their home currency.
3. Masala bonds typically offer higher yields compared to other debt instruments, providing Indian investors with an opportunity to earn higher returns on their investments.
4. Masala bonds can provide a boost to the Indian economy by attracting foreign capital and encouraging foreign entities to invest in the country. This can also help strengthen the Indian rupee by increasing demand for the currency.

The one major point which is missed here is that the ""credit rating"" agencies have not been doing a good job, rating bonds correctly. Senior Citizen investors may get trapped into buying these bonds( with perceived high ratings) in a high debt, risky enterprises with bad debt/equity ratios.

In a super high liquidity, valuations and growth inflated market such as the one we are in, I wish you explicitly explain the risks involved in believing what we see. ( Rating agencies have literally been useless in rating the securities, their incentives are misaligned)
