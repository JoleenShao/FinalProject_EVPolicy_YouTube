tl:dr: Petrol engine: 27.5% gasoline energy efficiency; Electric vehicle: 77% energy efficiency. Less nickel mined required than gasoline. Look down for more detail.

A road legal car‚Äôs gasoline engine has an energy efficiency rate of 20% - 35%. This is because energy cannot be destroyed nor created, only converted. In this case, the fuel once converted is mostly converted into other things (my guess is heat, because engines are hot but this is only my guess) and only a third becomes kinetic energy.
On the other hand 77% of nickel is converted into kinetic energy in an electric vehicle. Its way more efficient to use electric vehicles since you can use less nickel to use a car compared to petrol engines.
This makes it cheaper and its better for the environment since you don‚Äôt need to mine as much.

Even if electric vehicles is just doing the dirty stuff somewhere else, in the end:
More energy; Cheaper energy; Cleaner energy

Rare Earth Minerals Pose Challenge in Clean Energy Transition
In the United States, most mines are in the Appalachian region and the West. However, these mines supply very little of the United States‚Äô mineral usage. Nearly all‚Äî75-100%‚Äîof rare earth elements need to be imported. As of 2020 China is the largest miner of rare earth minerals.

Right now, the United States relies on China to mine and refine the rare earth elements used in domestic solar panel production and other equipment manufacturing. The Department of Labor reports Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, China produce polysilicon, a rare earth element necessary for producing solar panels, under forced labor conditions. These human rights abuses affect our nation‚Äôs economic relationship with China.

Thats just the building faze. 
The previous 15 years was all the red tape.

There is no way in 11 years the government can build the millions of miles of new high capacity power lines. 

There is no way that in 11 years the government can build thousands of charging stations across this country. 

There is no way that in 11 years millions of people can afford to upgrade the power panels and cables in their home to charge an electric car. 

There will be thousands if not millions of court case filed.

It makes me wonder how are the electric vehicles going to handle very cold weather like up in the northern states. There are winters that lows are 30 below zero for lows and highs of 15 to 20 below zero for the highs. I have seen some vehicles start hard with a gas or diesel engine and you have to let them warm up just to drive or you can not see where you are going. Now everyone knows cold weather zaps the batteries in cold weather. Not every place has plug-in to plug your vehicles in the winter. Most businesses do not have that up here. We as northerners do not get to plug-in our vehicles at work only at home. How are you going to keep that battery from not freezing up and still be able to get juice out of it when needed and also stay warm while traveling. I just do not think it will work in cold weather.,none,,2023-12-02 21:51:09.368956,0.0

I like his focus on facts, his polite style and willingness to allow the questions to be answered, not trying to talk over the other person until giving them some time to respond, but then pointing out more facts‚Ä¶. and how there will be consequences for failure to implement a science based solution.

I wish BuyMeThen, BuyAJudge and GrannyHome would emphasize getting solar on rooftops ‚Ä¶making average income homeowners more energy self sufficient and reducing the load on the grid as the first solution towards a greener future.  Once in place, people will want to shift to electric cars.

The other opportunity would be to deploy NASA engineers to developing the ideal blend of electric hybrid cars and trucks that can plug in and run electric, but also have the capability to burn gas or hydrogen or other fuels and continue to function in cold conditions.  

Why would a household need two cars with 300 mile EV range if the daily round trip is typically about 50 miles?  Why not focus on 50 miles EV range and a small fuel engine capable of extending the range via fossil fuels when traveling longer distance‚Ä¶. much like an on board generator‚Ä¶.and install 120 volt electric outlets in parking lots that will help boost the 50 mile range while the car is parked?  This would facilitate 100 pct EV power at much lower cost ( the batteries in cars are a massive proportion of total costs) ‚Ä¶.. and most of the daily drive needs are well below the EV range.  We need to optimize EVs for cost and have a hybrid fuel option to go longer distances.  Recharge and refuel time also much shorter with a small EV battery.

We have to get smarter about the solutions rather than using massive quantities of rare minerals.  Speaking of, the battery technology is already been figured out that could replace lithium such as liquid metal batteries.  Mandate cheaper battery chemistries and make them open source no patent constraints.

Using 39 miles per day by 365 days by 350 watts per mile, divided by 90% charging efficiency equals 5536 kwh compared to his 7480  kwh (4x1870). So his number is  26% high or using and using a different calculation, 35% more than the actual average EV consumption.   5536 is 26% less than 7480 or 7480 is 35% more than 5536.

The part of the equation that is customarily left out in these kinds of conversations is the electrical DEMAND factor.   Usage is one thing; demand entirely different.  If (for example) you have millions of Americans arriving home at 5:35pm and all plugging their electric vehicles in at once, you will have a very serious DEMAND on the electricity supplier that will require quite a robust infrastructure to accommodate.  Parent companies of electrical suppliers like Georgia Power, Duke Power, etc. have known of this demand issue for a very long time but have done little to address it.  Even before EV's were considered at the magnitude they are today, these power companies (The Southern Company, for example) have been defiant in their disdain for controlling DEMAND for residential users of their services.  Time of Use metering systems for residential applications was a battle sorely fought with these providers to give home-owners incentive to save on electrical demand.  It's a long complicated story that most politicians want no part of considering they're battling companies like The Southern Company and their deep purses.   In short, there is practically no way our country is going to build a grid in just a few years that will handle the level of demand required to meet the requirements of commuters.  So either the 'plan' involves shedding commuters (or limiting the commute to work) or some other means of transportation will have to be implemented in order to control electrical demand.",none,,2023-12-02 21:51:10.186798,0.0

At todays levels you cannot charge your EV and run household air conditioning on the same day the grid cannot support the drain. In several other areas if a factory or company requested permission to have a charging station for say twelve EV trucks every city so far has denied that request as it would more than double the electrical power drain for that township or city. So to make it feasible not only even when taking into account that latest power generation systems are far more effective. At minimum also when considering maintaining current power stations are at or beyond their expected service life at current levels. The amount of power station needed at fifty percent levels as per 2030 requirements. Before you even allow to take in account of the curve of projected power needs for households and industry. Five to six to one ratio of new stations for existing capacity. At the full level double that figure. So not only will the logistics of supply of fuel to run them be huge. The only realistic solution would be to mainly use nuclear powered stations. Again now far beyond next level over existing stations with even the fuel rods now safe and simple to decommission and recycle. To say they are dangerous is akin to claiming the dangers of air travel due to what happened to the Hindenburg. On top of that the distribution grid would require a total replacement from the point of generation to the consumer unit connecting your home. That will be by far many times the costs of the power stations. So not only will a tiny percentage of the old money bankers and investors earn huge massive returns. The mines in the USA for copper and uranium have been shut down. So China and Russia will gladly sell all you need at bargain inflated prices.

Electric commuter vehicles are irrelevant to emissions reduction, and so using our taxes to make small EVs cheaper and more available is not an efficient policy, nor is raising fuel standards, which actually just makes vehicles more expensive to buy.  

How will all this talk accelerate the development of electric inter city and regional freight systems, mining and agricultural equipment, etc where most of the emissions come from?

Also is EV even the right technology for Australia (with our long distances travelled)?  Hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell technology are more suitable, and offer a realistic emissions reduction strategy.  Sure hybrids use petrol, but the fact that studies show that people use hybrids this way actually proves why all-electric vehicles are impractical.  Promoting ""all electric"" vehicles is inappropriate for Australia and a step in the wrong direction.  

My first electric vehicle will be a plug in hybrid, with a bidirectional inverter so I can use the battery for my home in the evening, and still have the ability to drive the car in the morning.

if you take from Hyd -> Suryapet-> Khammam -> Badrachalam -> Odisha - ----> Not even one EV charging facility available, 

so please let the EV companies who are responsible on behalf of the customer know the more EV charging infrastructure develops, the more consumer you will find,

 I recently came across your theory about electric vehicles (EVs) not being a value-for-money choice compared to petrol cars, and I wanted to share my perspective on the matter.

Firstly, you mentioned that the excess amount spent on purchasing an EV could be invested in the share market or mutual funds to generate good returns. While investing in the financial markets can potentially yield profits, it's important to consider a couple of points regarding your theory.

Nobody buys a car with cash: In reality, most people purchase cars through financing options such as bank loans or leasing. When you opt for a loan, the additional 5 lakh rupees you mentioned would add to the loan amount, resulting in a slightly higher monthly payment. In this case, your theory of investing the excess amount wouldn't apply directly since you are still required to repay the loan.
Where will the excess 5 lakh come from if you are buying it via a bank loan? If you are considering taking a bank loan to buy a car, the loan amount will cover the full cost of the car. In this scenario, there won't be any extra money available to invest in the share market or mutual funds. The loan repayment will be based on the total cost of the vehicle, regardless of whether it's a petrol car or an EV.
Additionally, it's important to note that evaluating the value for money of an EV extends beyond the initial purchase cost. EVs typically have lower operational and maintenance expenses compared to petrol cars. The cost of electricity required to charge an EV is significantly lower than the cost of petrol. Moreover, EVs have fewer moving parts and typically require less frequent maintenance, resulting in potential savings over the long run.

Furthermore, various governments and organizations offer incentives, tax benefits, and subsidies for purchasing EVs, which can help offset the initial higher cost. These incentives, combined with potential fuel and maintenance savings, can make owning an EV a more cost-effective option over time.

It's crucial to consider the broader picture when assessing the value for money of EVs.  The transition to electric mobility is gaining momentum globally, with advancements in technology and infrastructure further enhancing the viability and appeal of EVs.

I believe it's worth exploring the comprehensive advantages and disadvantages of EVs before making a judgment solely based on the upfront cost.",none,,2023-12-02 21:51:13.783851,0.0

2. Secondly in your comparison you say that EV insurance costs are higher than ICE cars which isn‚Äôt true at all. In your own calculations it is 5% of the ex showroom price
3. GST for EVs is just 5% compared to 28% + 3% cess for diesel

Even if we assume that we run 50 kms daily and that the range is 250 kms, we will need a full charge once in 5 days. This means the battery can be easily used for 15,000 days (41 years!!!)  or 7.5 lakh kms. Most ICE engines run into serious problems once they cross 1.5-2 lakh kms

2) With increase in Electric vehicles, the energy consumption will also increase. Rough estimates average Units will be 0.5 Kwhr/km means if vehicles run 50 km per month 25KWhr per month , per year will be 300KWhr energy is required now multiple it with number of vehicles 7 crores ( estimate 4 wheels only ) = 21 TWhr of energy is required per year fun fact India has consumption of only 1600 Twhr ( 2019 to 2020) only. Imagine the cost of infrastructure required just to accommodate 7 crores vehicles only and the unit of electricity will increase because of that. Haven't included the amount of KWhr of units required just to manufacture those cars.
3) The amount of Carbon emissions just to create that much batteries, electric motors and recycle alloys.

I m more likely to take more trips including leisure trips if the cost is 1/10 of the petrol cost.

During the pandemic years fossil fuel consumption went way down, and there was no detectable impact on planetary atmospheric CO2 levels after the massive and prolonged reduction. Meaning that rising CO2 levels cannot be directly linked to the burning of fossil fuels. 

CO2 levels are a planetary phenomenon. There are massive pools of available carbon on the planet besides the atmosphere such as the ocean sediments, volcanoes, decaying matter, carbonaceous rock. The bio geophysical processes that drive the massive scale natural exchanges of carbon , which result in the level of atmospheric CO2 scientist measure are largely unknown. 

But what scientist do know is that historically CO2 levels have not driven changes in the temperature or climate because there have been colder periods with higher CO2 levels than today and warmer periods with lower CO2 levels than today. 

In other words, CO2 levels do not change the planet, the planet changes CO2 levels.",none,,2023-12-02 21:51:30.761648,0.0

How do you get to heaven?
Very simple: Admit that you're not Innocent, you're guilty and ask for mercy.

How to know if you're guilty or not?
Simply: Compare your life to the Ten Commandments God gave you in the Bible.
Everyone agrees that if people followed the ten commandments there would be no need for governments or police.

Do not lie.
Do not steal.
Do not commit adultery.
Do not insult God by using his name as a cuss word.
There are six more but let's just leave it at that.

How many lies have you told in your life?

Have you ever taken anything that didn't belong to you?

Jesus said, if you look at a women lustfully you've already committed adultery in your heart with that woman.
How many times a day do you do that?

Do you use God's name as a cuss word?
Would you do that with your own mother's name?

If you answer these questions honestly you know that you're guilty.

God can justly punish you and send you to hell.

Ask him for mercy.
His name is Jesus.

It's as simple as this, The Ten Commandments are called the moral law. You and I broke God's laws. Jesus paid the fine.
The fine is death.

Ezekiel 18:20 ‚Äî 
""The soul who sins shall die.

That's why Jesus had to die on the cross for our sins. This is why God is able to give us Mercy.

Option A.
You die for your own sins.

Option B.
Ask for mercy and accept that Jesus died on the cross for you

1. introduce a graded congestion charge, particularly for busy inner city streets during peak times.  Rates can start of as simple Red Amber Green (or similar), which motor vehicles are charged for using Red and Amber roads during peak, shoulder times. Congestion charges have worked quite well in places like London.

2. Introduce a energy transition levy, which is 100% spent on helping people electrify their lives: EVs, Heat Pumps, household PV and VPP batteries. This would be a tax levied on hydrocarbon use, effectively a carbon tax. So we could keep our big gas burners as long as we want to keep paying the energy transition levy, but the sooner we switch the sooner we stop paying it.

3. RBA TFF (Transition Funding Facility), where the RBA will provide a discount window for repo type loans for banks and financial to fund low interest loans for certified energy transition programs, specifically helping businesses and households pay for industrial heat pumps, PVs, EV charging infrastructure, community batteries. Yes I know that this would add inflationary pressures in a situation where the RBA has said they will do everything they can to eliminate inflation.  Nevertheless, I think that during this energy transition, the RBA should both increase it's inflation target to between 2-5% and keep up pressures on the cash rate as well as increased taxation to channel more resources toward into the energy transition.

Road tax should be one yearly fixed rate for all vehicle types levied to pay for the upkeep or the road network. Income tax fairly based on an individuals salary etc,  should be used for all other government expenditure.

- Here is the UK, I have a Plug in hybrid (Ampera) which is road tax exempt and I cycle quite a lot which costs be nothing too. I wouldn't mind paying road tax or even a bicycle tax if the money went to maintaining the roads and building an excellent cycle network.

- A taxation system of pay per mile to bring EV car fueling taxation  in line with ICE car fueling taxation seems crazy when your already outlaying twice as much money for an EV than a comparable ICE car for the greater good of society. In fact here in the land of Whingeing Poms (it's true) I would go the other way and removed the 20% VAT on electric cars until such times an EV costs as much as ICE car to purchase, this would bring a Tesla Model 3 to under ¬£40.000 which is still an extortionate amount of money in ""Rip Off Britain"" but maybe just about do-able for lots of families.",none,,2023-12-02 21:51:37.828178,1.0

firstly despite claims to the contrary fuel excise does not go directly into road infrastructure funding. It is assimilated like most taxes into general revenue, then some of it may indeed be allocated to road funding depending on gov priorities.
Secondly it has been proven that to promote new technologies that are perceived as socially desirable but initially more expensive and paradigm changing, early adopters are motivated by reduced set up costs and in some cases government subsidies to assist reduce capital and operational costs.
We in Australia have all experienced the boom in roof top solar uptake due to good policy settings.
I believe electric cars deserve similar support which can be gradually rolled back as EV adoption targets are met and revenue streams mature.
If we really cared about the quality of the air we breath the environment and minimising the public health costs of burning fossil fuels I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a stack of money available if we could roll back the tax subsidies for fossil fuel companies, and build a pollution tax into the cents per litre fuel price if people wish to continue to pollute.

Toyota Motor Corporation has committed an environmental crime and chemical genocide against the People of Russia. Look at these scales, 219,811 thousand cars with a defective fuel system were sold in Russia. ‚ÄúWith prolonged use of a car with a crack, it may increase, which, in turn, can lead to leakage of fuel vapors, and in extreme cases (with a completely filled fuel tank), there is a possibility of fuel leakage,‚Äù Rosstandart explains. If we take the leakage of vapors and the fuel itself into one liter per day, then this is already 220,000 liters entered the atmosphere, which is 6,600,000 liters per month. Most likely, a liter per week evaporated somewhere, it was imperceptible even to the owner of the car, but this is 220,000 liters of gasoline, 880,000 liters per month, 10,560,000 liters per year. These are billions, trillions of cubic meters of air poisoned by gasoline vapors. And now let's see the harmful effects of gasoline on human health: 300 gr. gasoline spilled while refueling a car pollutes 200 thousand m3 of air. Inhalation of gasoline vapors causes dizziness, headache, feeling of intoxication, sleep disturbance, sweating, fatigue, causeless lethargy, slight muscle twitching, loss of appetite, agitation, nausea, vomiting, trembling of outstretched arms, muscle cramps. Light poisoning with gasoline vapors can occur after 5-10 minutes. human stay in the atmosphere with the concentration of gasoline vapors ranging from 900 to 3612 mg/m3. With a short inhalation of air with a gasoline vapor concentration of 5,000 to 10,000 mg / m3, after a few minutes, a headache, discomfort in the throat, cough, irritation of the mucous membranes of the nose, eyes appear. m3) after 10-12 breaths a person becomes poisoned, loses consciousness; over 3% (40 g / m3) lightning-fast poisoning occurs (2-3 breaths) - rapid loss of consciousness and death. In Toyota's Corolla Owner's Manual. No. OM 12C40R . Part 01999 - 12C40. Printrd in japan 02-0809-01‚Äù on page 46 says that gasoline vapors are harmful to health when inhaled, thus Toyota itself recognizes the danger of gasoline vapors to human health. Toyota Motor Corporation knew and represented the danger and harm that gasoline vapor had to human health and the environment.

Here's what's really going to happen...the early adopters chomping at the bit to try out the new tech will buy in until they hit a wall.  That wall will be a hard stop of reality when everyone else who does NOT want an EV refuses to ""do what they're told and buy an electric car"" refuse to do so.  There's me, my wife, and soon to be 3 kids all who have to have cars to get to jobs and commute to college.  Explain to me exactly how we are supposed to charge 5 cars every single day.  Play ring-around-the-rosey moving the cars into the garage to get access to the charger?  

You know how everyone will play the ""who gets to use the phone charger based on who's battery is lowest"" game right now?  That's irritating.  And all you have to do is unplug it from one phone and plug it into the other.  Imagine having to move cars in and out of the garage 5 times per day...EVERY day.  You can save it brother.  I have no interest in that. 

And what about all the people living in apartments and condos?  You think that these places are going to spend millions and millions of dollars trenching high voltage power lines into the parking lots so that every spot will have a charger?  I don't think they will.  And the apartment dwellers are certainly not going to pay for it.  And what?  You think the GOVERNMENT is going to pay for that?  I think not.  So apartment people are not going to be doing buy-in en masse.

When they can make a battery canister the size of a Coleman camping lantern that runs a standard Toyota Camry style car for 2 days of average driving and that cannister can be swapped out at the local station in a matter of minutes like a propane tank....THAT will be the point where you can expect to get buy-in from the public that exceeds 50% of all vehicle sales.  If these companies think that they can just FORCE us to buy electric cars by just.... not offering gas cars...they got another thing coming.  I'll just drive the current vehicle.  Or buy used.  I prefer to buy new...but if they try to pigeon-hole me into buying an electric car....I won't.  I'll just look for cars with low mileage driven by old ladies.  I think I can make it to the end of my life driving those.  And armies of other people will be like me on that.  And when new car sales collapse...the car companies will discover that kissing the ring of the government and just doing what they say about forcing EVs down our throats...well...that's gonna put them in the grave.  We're NOT gonna switch.  You have about 25% demand MAX before the industry hits the wall and then wonders... ""What happened?  Where did all the buyers go?""",none,,2023-12-02 21:51:52.244063,0.0

Henry ford created the very first electric ‚ö°Ô∏è car but out of greed from the oil industry and the greedy banking system he had no other choice to go the way of the combustible engine and greed kept the change from happening the whole time and it wasn‚Äôt until this whole movement of save the planet üåé started happening it was a half ass let‚Äôs start making some changes but greed still kept any true changes happening when it came to the automotive industry. And greed still was happening but it wasn‚Äôt until Elon musk came out of nowhere and created Tesla and shocked the world and that‚Äôs when the United States started taking notice and started to push this whole narrative of when need to go even greener with electric cars cause are planet depends on it,what it really was here is some guy shaking up the auto industry and doing it in a large way and was eating up profits so they ‚Äúall‚Äù started to push an agenda of let‚Äôs get this done by 2035 without realizing the ramifications. I will give some,
Greed caused it where there is no infrastructure at all to support the mass amount of vehicles that will be on the road,to expensive for anyone to pay for because greed has caused it to be a situation cause if this would have been 25 years ago as we all know prices of everything would have been cheaper cause the market would have competition and growth for building the infrastructure and the providing of power I.e. solar panels and more. I mean I can go on shall I,the greed will cost bunch of people there jobs and livelihood cause if this slow transition would have gradually happened over time those workers in combustible manufacturing would have been trained and prepared for the next evolution of vehicles,again from the oil industry need I say anymore. I mean I can go on,people going homeless because of it cause they weren‚Äôt helped,people complaining about the homeless getting worse which will have been caused by unprepared. I can go on and on how I‚Äôll prepared we are and that we are already dealing with heat waves,rolling blackouts and you got municipalities telling people sorry we turned off your electricity so you can‚Äôt charge your cars. So here‚Äôs another problem with it by pushing something way to fast,how are the people gonna afford solar panels on their roof to pay for the electricity for their vehicle cause we all know using your regular electricity ‚ö°Ô∏è will in turn cost üí≤ you an arm and a leg and power companies aren‚Äôt going to help customers with their consumption of electricity ‚ö°Ô∏è. I mean I can keep going on and on ,electric car transition is the greatest idea,but this should have been done 25 years ago and please no give me the bs about we didn‚Äôt have that technology,you‚Äôll just look dumb.

Abraham Lincoln was just one man who took risks to end slavery. He didn‚Äôt do it alone. In fact, he kinda dragged his feet. But he deserves some credit. OTOH, when some jerk in Washington says ‚Äúhe‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äù fought to get you this or that they usually fought for themselves.

If unions did anything positive, it may have been pushing some of these reforms along faster than they might have come otherwise, but let‚Äôs be real, they did it while sucking lots of value out of the economy for themselves and their members that wasn‚Äôt even mostly paid by employers. It got paid by average people with less power. And all along, they created lots of trouble and bad politics and other bad outcomes.

A close friend farms over 10,000 acres of corn in the mid-west. The property is spread out over 3 counties. His operation is a ""partnership farm"" with John Deere. They use the larger farm operations as demonstration projects for promotion and development of new equipment.

He recently received a phone call from his John Deere representative, and they want the farm to go to electric tractors and combines in 2023. He currently has 5 diesel combines that cost $900,000 each that are traded in every 3 years. Also, over 10 really BIG tractors.

JD wants him to go all electric soon.

He said: ""Ok, I have some questions. How do I charge these combines when they are 3 counties away from the shop in the middle of a cornfield, in the middle of nowhere?"" ""How do I run them 24 hours a day for 10 or 12 days straight when the harvest is ready, and the weather is coming in?"" ""How do I get a 50,000+ lb. combine that takes up the width of an entire road back to the shop 20 miles away when the battery goes dead?""

There was dead silence on the other end of the phone.

When the corn is ready to harvest, it has to have the proper sugar and moisture content. If it is too wet, it has to be put in giant dryers that burn natural or propane gas, and lots of it. Harvest time is critical because if it degrades in sugar content or quality, it can drop the value of his crop by half a million dollars or more. It is analyzed at time of sale. It is standard procedure to run these machines 10 to 12 days straight, 24 hours a day at peak harvest time. When they need fuel, a tanker truck delivers it, and the machines keep going.

John Deere's only answer is ""we're working on it."" They are being pushed by the lefty Dems in the government to force these electric machines on the American farmer. These people are out of control. They are messing with the production of food crops that feed people and livestock... all in the name of their ""green dream.""

Bringing people over without qualification and giving them a lot of benefits made the industry extremely attractive. Naturally, people started to try to figure out ways to get into said industry.

The first step was better qualification for the manufacturing itself and trying to land themselves into technologic development slots. This saw a dramatic increase in the number of workers who had huge qualification and a decrease in the need of less qualified jobs due to increased machinery efficiency. The main issue of people with high qualification is that... They are still as human as their less qualified predecessors. In short, they have to invest a lot more time and money into qualification, mainly formal education and specialized industrial training.

This creates a far less flexible workforce in a world which is only ever picking speed in how fast it changes. Remember the part where workers are only human? Well, they have the same needs as the ones that came before them had! While food prices are usually declining (counting inflation, of course), the rate at which they drop is far slower than the rate of the increase in costs for education and training, and the house and energy market are monsters with an ever increasing hunger for resources. The workers have bills and mortgages to pay for!

So they take the next step: Offer their services for cheaper. Eventually, this gets to a point where they are ""willing"" to accept payments lower than the minimum wages set by regulatory agents, and they act on. The result, obviously, is unemployment.",none,,2023-12-02 21:51:52.881407,0.0

1) Improve hybrids - these will lessen range anxiety and short falls with existing battery technology and infrastructure whilst keeping current manufacturing jobs as-is.  

2) Hydrogen/hybrid electric as the next replacement for traditional ICEs.  The infrastructure is already in place with  retrofitting required at refuelling stations.  Similar refuel rate as traditional fossil fuel as well as range extending hybrid electric.  Seems like a win/win especially as battery tech continues to improve.  In fact use the hydrogen power plant to charge the batteries instead of propulsion and the vehicle could run for hundreds of miles. 

Design & build dedicated hybrid/hydrogen vehicle platforms using 2-cylinder hydrogen engines with batteries the floor much like todays all electric vehicles.  A small 100hp two cylinder would take up very little space and could be designed in a flat configuration for improved low CoG packaging.

The batteries actually causing a fire is only part of the problem. Most car fires, ICE or EV are caused by an electrical fault, EV's are more likely to have an electrical fault. Add to that that EV's carry a half ton battery that contains the makings of a chemical fire. The lithium contained in the battery is self igniting and with the other chemicals and or water, self oxidising. Once ignited these fires are very difficult if not impossible to put out. Spraying water may contain the fire, and help to reduce the temperature, but wont put it out. If the battery catches fire, regardless of how the fire starts, you have a singularly different situation to an ICE vehicle fire. The battery is a chemical bomb and once ignited there is little you can do to extinguish it.

Unlike an ICE vehicle fire, which the fuel wont contribute to if the tank is empty, it doesn't matter how much charge is in the battery. It is still a bomb, charged or discharged.",none,,2023-12-02 21:52:02.436719,0.0

As batteries get older they lose some ability to hold a charge and when charging they may run hotter and catch fire.
While the risk of an EV catching fire while charging is very low that risk could be catastrophic when most EV's are charged at home at night and the home could catch fire as well.
Another factor not included is when an EV gets in a car accident on the road and the batteries appear not to have suffered any damage visually, but have.
The 30 to 80% charging level for EV batteries seem to be the best for the durability of the batteries, but at how many cycles does the risk of battery fire increase? I don't think we know this yet for all EV's under all circumstances with all different types of EV batteries.

The ratio is something like 1 in 100 car fires is in a fully electric car. Hybrid cars are not electric cars; they burn fossil fuel. Those are the ones with something of a fire problem, caused by their complexity and the fact that they have to problems of a liquid fuelled car with the small addition of potential flammability of a battery. But that risk of a fire is still very low; something like 12 in a million, according to some sources. (Fully Charged covered this, for example.) To narrow it down further, by far the most likely chance of a battery fire comes from hybrids with Lithium-Ion batteries manufactured in China by LG.¬†

Modern BEV's are transitioning to Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries, which have a far less likely chance of catching fire. The most popular car in the world right now is the Tesla Model Y. It outsells all fossil fuelled cars. The Model Y Standard Range is the most popular Model Y, and it uses a battery made from LFP cells. 

Remember that the BEV fire risk is already way lower than that for conventionally fuelled cars, so the use of LFP cells reduces that risk even further.

There is a huge amount of misinformation being propagated by oil companies and some traditional car manufacturers such as Toyota which is designed to deter people from buying BEV's. So anyone reading headlines such as this on will need to check the real facts about EV's before believing anti-EV FUD blindly.



One outstanding point is that EV's are newsworthy, whereas petroleum fuelled vehicles are not.mNews media are concerned primarily with clicks, views and sales. Truth lags behind profit, so an EV fire becomes a ripe field for harvesting in this regard.¬†

In contrast, it's noteworthy that the huge fire at Luton airport, in England, which destroyed about 1,500 vehicles, stopped flights and tied up over 100 firefighters for almost two days, whilst destroying a four year old multi storey car park which didn't have a sprinkler system, only made the news because of the amount of damage which was done, and the disruption it has caused. In a small footnote, it was mentioned that the fire started in a Diesel-powered Range Rover. Not in an EV. No mention is made of the number of motorway vehicle fires which happen almost invariably in Diesel and gasoline powered vehicles every day of the year in Britain.

Be honest; how many gasoline or Diesel vehicle fires have you seen or experienced? And of the now millions of fully electric vehicles on the roads, how many fires in them have you witnessed? For most people, the answer to the second question is 'very few', or 'none'. I've seen countless liquid fuelled vehicle fires, and no electric vehicle fires. I've been in two vehicles which were on the brink of a fire, when fuel sprayed from a porous fuel hose or cracked pipe, onto a hot exhaust manifold. In both cases, the quick action of the driver saved the vehicle, and one of those incidents was with my own car. I've also helped to save another gasoline fuelled car which caught fire whilst being serviced.

Anyone involved in the industry will attest to the fact that corporate capitol is not being spent on EVs, its instead being allocated to Hydrogen powered vehicles in both conventional engine arrangements and fuel cell arrangements. 
....
Battery powered EVs will cease to exist over the next 7 years. as the growing concern of their ability to create massive fires while unattended will come to the forefront of their eventual demise.   Surety companies are already vastly raising the cost of coverage for such vehicles, while scrap yards and the vehicle towing industry are refusing to handle EVs due to their ability to reignite and cause major damage. 
....
One EV fire can completely engulf multiple structures in closely located residential buildings.   Further, such ignition can be spontaneous, occurring without warning.   EV fires burn at an average of 5000 deg. f.  (2760 Celsius), and are extremely difficult for fire departments to extinguish.    Fire departments are reporting that it takes about 300 gallons of water to extinguish a gasoline vehicle fire and once its extinguished it remains extinguished.   Fire officials state that EV fires take between 10k to 40k gallons of water to initially extinguish and they can reignite afterward, several times.  
That is the inherent, and severe danger posed by EVs.    

.......
Because EVs have a politically motivated existence, the ability to address their inherent design failure is currently extinguished.   It will take multiple acts of loss of life, prior to this battery issue being finally put to rest.

According to the EV fanboys there is only one moving part in an EV , Point one EVs are either made in China then imported to the UK the money just straight out the country .two/ An EV made in the UK is not made here its just assembled and the company has to given billions of tax payers money for the factory to here ,and then the money just out the country anyway .

3/ dirty old piston engine vehicles . we are told have over 2000 parts ,they have to be tested every year and must be compliant so have emissions tests associated with all of the equipment . And someone has to make thos 2000 parts & they have families & mortgauges to pay .
So with the coming of the super green EVs people were getting paid to charge them ,There was a grant to buy them , they had froo road tax ,parking , Then charge for free at supermarkets ,dealers , then travel for pennies , that all disappeard and now its costs more to charge than to fill a diesel and diesel is more expensive in the UK than petrol .

Then the costs of insurance premiums shot up we find that EVs being transported on ships have self ignighted and due to the fact that a Lithium battery fire cant be put out with water /Co2 or Halon they are left to burn as is with Lithium battery fires in homes where E skate boards /E bikes /scooters /& mobility scooters have caught ablaze due to the thermal runaway effect of a Lithium battery catching alight . There is also a problem with some of  the charging systems going over the top , i own a mobility scooter its 60v there is room for one more battery but mine are lead acid ,The charger says 60v on the front but 72 v on the back , on looking on the frame there is a tag that says 72 v , the charger is supposed to be a smart one it only turned its self off twice after that it just keeps going ,i now time it and disconect it at 65v .

TV news outlets wont discuss the issues with EVs or the problems associated with Lithium batteries because for one they are part of the great Green sysrem and the money is to big
The reality is if you have something with a Lithium battery do not charge it over night and put a smake alarm close to it if you do ,Inc the EV !

Another factor is the amount of EVs catching alight both on the road or at home charging up over night , your home insurance will go up if you have a home charger .
The rise in premiums came after Covid  , The insurance industry took a big hit on their hedge funds after Covid and then a bigger hit with the Thermal runaway with Lithium Battery fires , One factor in this is you cant use water /Co2 or Halon on a lithium based fire 
Insurance companies are aware of this so the risk of fire is greater if you have lithium batteries charging at home or being transported on a ship .

If an insurance company or group has to pay out for ship fire it runs into hundreds of millions or worse hence the whole markey is affected  and the public get to pay the price .

Electrical fires are generally heat related, and usually the result of high resistance relative to electrical connections. 
Each time a circuit connector is used, it heats up, it only takes you picking up your cell phone while its charging from a deep discharge to understand that point. 
However, if you eject a CD from your vehicles CD player after 30min to 1 hour of its use, you will also understand the heat being generated inside your cars radio, while playing that CD. 

So what happens as circuit connectors heat up and cool down over several cycles?    The answer is simple,  they tend to relax, creating a larger and larger gap between the connectors.  The larger the gap the higher the resistance and the more amperage required to make the connection.  More amperage equates to higher heat and eventually .... heat so high it becomes a source of ignition. 

Inside an EV battery there are lots of connectors.   Most of these connectors are copper since the atom structure of copper is very conducive to electrical current flow.  The downfall of copper however, is that it tends to deform under high heat,  When connectors deform, they cause resistance, that resistance causes temperatures to soar when attempting to supply current for the vehicles propulsion systems and other electronics.   This high temperature can cause the copper bits to glow and therefore become a fire source.  The worst condition for an EV would be where the battery has been continually drained for a long period of time, and the further the demand for amperage at low charge rates, the higher the heat will become.   Parking your EV after a nice long run, especially in the rain, they parking it in your garage over night, allows the batter temperature to continue to rise. if the liquid content of the battery starts to boil, then the battery will likely catch fire. This is know historically as heat soak, and although it happens to gasoline vehicle engines, the contents of the heat soaked components are not likely to catch fire. 

The reason we don't see many fires relative to hybrid cars is because power for the vehicle is supplied via a gasoline generator and not specifically from the battery pack. Further, with hybrid vehicles, parasitic devices (power steering, Air Conditioning, etc) are operated as a component of the gasoline engine.  Therefore they don't place undue stresses on the battery pack. 

So, if you own an EV, and you have drained the battery at or past 1/2 its maximum charge, you might want to think about, ways you can cool the battery pack down prior to either parking it in the garage or charging it for the evening.  The other consideration would be to not allow your EV to discharge at a rapid rate, and never allow your EV to loose more than 35%-40% if its full charge without recharging it and letting it cool down fully, before reusing it.  
The whole idea is relative to heat, and a discharging EV battery generates quite a bit of heat.   If you really want to know how hot your EV battery gets, acquire a simple thermometer which measures via infrared, and  test the battery pack temp for the vehicle when its fully charged and hasn't been operating for a few days.   Then make note of the temperature after you have used it normally.    Your alarm bells should go off if you find the battery temperature at or exceeding the boiling point range.   

Where gasoline engines and their related counterparts will operate at 195 deg F, that's a normal operating temperature and all components are designed to operate at that temperature, without failure.   EVs however don't generate heat due to combustion, they generate heat due to current flow, and as of yet, I have not observed an EV which indicates external and internal battery temperature, nor data which indicates the acceptable range of either.  

Yes EVs are a fire hazard, one which needs to be considered prior to ever purchasing one...   Call your insurance company prior to ever considering the purchase of an EV, you just might find that not only will your vehicle insurance vastly increase, but your homeowners liability might vastly increase as well.   Since the risk of an EV catching on fire unattended is quite high,   it poses a severe risk to you, your family, your home, and the other properties near its proximity.",none,,2023-12-02 21:52:03.097191,0.0

Lots of car collectors,  hot rods, Ferraris and Lamborghinis and other cars unique to regular fuel. Im sure Jamie Foxx isn't going to give up his Bentley...lol!!! Me personally, i wouldn't mind having an electric car but first they have to be perfected. They have to come down in price, They have to come up with a way to cut the charge time in half atleast, they have to come out with a great deal of styles because, i hate driving down the street and seeing 20 other cars just like mine. Here in Pennsylvania i see alot of Teslas that are the same style, and color. I see Tesla cars that are really smooth looking to that i believe are the high end Teslas. Mercedes has some kool EVs also but everyone knows that anything Mercedes is for the rich and requires an arm and leg to own. You don't buy a car, you buy an emblem, a three prong star in a circle. The same with Lexus. You are spending a fortune for the letter,  L. Evs have a long ways to go before i even think about getting one. I have a Buick Lacrosse 2014 hybrid. My battery went bad on me and had to replace it. The cost was 1500 dollars. If the batteries go in an EV you better get yourself a loan for anywhere between 7 and 11 thousand dollars. Both my buick lacrosse and a Nissan pathfinder 2020 are paid off and im not for getting back into a car payment for awhile. I maintain them, and i keep them cleaned and polished at all times. EVs have to be made to handle the extreme cold and heat. Here in the northeast we do get bitter cold winters with heavy snows and summers with hot and humid heat waves. I still would love to have a Cadillac Fleetwood 1996. No car is made today with that kind of comfort and the luxury of a 1996 Cadillac Fleetwood. Infact they were classified as, true American Luxury. I just have to find one. After 300,000 teslas were recalled and other EVs burst into flames,  i think i will wait and give EVs a chance to become stable and perfected.

The auto industry has had more than enough time to convert to a product with zero emissions and the population has willingly gone along with polluting the environment for profit as being OK.  The government has also had over half a century to produce policy to stop companies operating on a for profit basis that produce products that damage the environment or damage the environment during manufacturing and they have also ignored the problem and knowingly allowed the practice to proliferate and grow even providing financial, assistance to those companies and industries to continue doing damaging the environment for profit.

If anyone thinks this decision now is something great and you are patting yourself on the back for this pitiful gesture then you are delusional and your perception of the reality of the situation is wrong.

The human race has shown that it is never going to survive long term because it is so incapable of perceiving reality even remotely.

To be a species that would survive long term it would have stopped population growth at 4 billion people, it would have stuck with a zero emission vehicle from the start and never shelved the electric car in favor of the petrol car.  It would have pushed for a move away from energy production by burning fossil fuel at the latest 1950.  The polar ice caps would not be in the state they are in now, global warming would not still bed an issue and the planet would not have increased temperature so far that the permafrost would start to release methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  There would not be the level of deforestation and land clearing for farming because there would only be 4 billion people on the planet and the greatly reduced damage that goes along with that reduction in population.  The human race still hasn't even started to control population increases.  A species that doesn't react when its population goes from 1 billion in 1800 to 2 billion in 1900 and then 4 billion in 1950 and over 8 billion now and can't perceive even remotely how devastating that has been to the planets environment and that it is impossible for the planet to maintain any kind of stability with the radical changes that the human population has caused by increasing population size from 1 billion to 8 billion and introducing fossil fuel burning products and industries for a population of that size.  That you think that this pitiful policy allowing the auto industry to still continue producing pollution machines when they have had more than enough time to move to a product that doesn't produce any pollution, is very upsetting to me because I can see reality, I can see how incredibly insane the behavior is to allow companies to produce a product that does so much damage to the health of the environment for profit even when they could produce an alternate product that doesn't damage the environment and they don't change and no one does anything about it for over 70 years before you finally react in any measurable way and this is all you can manage.

I hope you like extinction as a future because you are heading straight at it behaving the way you are now.

An appropriate response would have been to shut down industries and stop production of products that damage the environment that supports all life on the planet and to have created laws to make that kind of behavior illegal and it would have happened within a decade of discovering that you were doing it, subsidizing the conversions to operations that do not damage the environment and you would have insisted that the companies that did the damage be held responsible for the cleanup and repair of the environment that they caused.  That species would have a great future and would be most likely to survive long enough to produce inter stellar travel.  That species would have some sanity and control over their greed impulses unlike humans who obviously have no control what so ever over their greedy behavior.",none,,2023-12-02 21:52:05.504193,0.0

 I told this to dealer, in reply of this he told subsidy of Rs 150000 is for customer and remaining rs. 65 k is manufacturer's incentive. Is it really true? Means somthing needs clarity. In fame 2 there is no such separate incentive mentioned.

As this policy is open till 2025 or 200000 ev ( precisely 20000cars only), which is still not completed yet , the rto charges are claimed by dealer.

One solution may help to avoid charging station and time for this charging.
Each EV car should have battery charging unit run by petrol..
Two sets of battery should be kept 
One in use mode while the other in charging mode during running of car 
When one set is loosing charges and  going empty,Then one changer already set in car is used to engage
 the  charged battery for running the car and the empty battery will go to charging mode. By this alteration one can run up to any distance.If charging station is found on the way one may charge the batteries.That facility should also be available with the car.
The battery charging unit that will run byPetrol, will consume less petrol than a standard petrol engine running car.

I am a Nexon EV user from past one year and just want to point out some valid counter arguments to some of the points mentioned in your video:

1) Insurance coverage : You are right in stating that insurance don't cover 100% battery and this is due to fact that we don't have any company issuing a separate policy wording for electric vehicles and they use that same ICE policy where 50% coverage point mentioned for all or most insurance providers. I had the same concern before purchase so raised this to Tata Motors team and they contacted all insurers using their inhouse insurance team. Based on that they sent a contact with email confirmation that few insurers will provide 100% battery coverage if Zero Dep policy is taken and from these i went ahead with Future Generali who gave the full battery cover plus a very nominal rate of insurance. I believe soon as the number of electric vehicle increases we will have insurance providers providing tailor made policies with such 100% battery coverage.

2) EV's are more polluting than ICE vehicle due to mining of rare earth metals and how electricity is produced: I don't want to mention any counter arguments but want to highlight another video from Youtube. This gives all the details for interested people. Please watch it as its a real eye opener.

Regarding warranty..... Every one same problem..petrol diesel and ev...
Electricity charges...forget that...further is solar...I am not paying single ruppe for electricity...
Future is secured....for 20yrs..

Pollution ...it not 100% green....but far far better compared to petrol...

For me the only down side of electric car is price......i expect better competitive prices when more companies start manufacturing....
No maintenance......not daily expenditure...

Regarding setup of charging point....we can charge with 16amp socket.....so even if u r in 10th floor..u can set a wire point...with a basic electrician...

1.) One major and very important point which has to be kept in view is that physical oil availability is reducing very fast also with the focus of EU and US  on movement of EV the exploration of more oil wells will soon be almost stopped. In this case the oil will be a rarer commodity . Also geo-politics and wars  in coming in next few years or decades will be more scary of an issue and Oil prices can really touch very high prices. Secondly future investments on ICE engines on Global scale will reduce a lot. Major shocks in Oil markets can be observed creating wild swings from very high prices to low prices. Take a look at us begging oil from Iran and Russia. Not only cost but physical availability can be disrupted.

2.) Lithium is a rare metal and the battery pack will fetch quite a bit of the cost once given for exchange unlike lead acid batteries. Though recycling is not completely developed due to low volume as people pick up more cars it will end up in a closed loop cycle. It will similar to gold ornaments where you will buy with incremental cost and not the complete cost.

3) If you use solar charging you can completely recover your whole cost of the battery in less than a few years.

4.) As number of EV's increase the charging stations infrastructure will scale up pretty fast as did the petrol pumps.

5.) The fire issues have been dealt with phosphate chemistry where EV's are 30 times less chances of fire than a IC engine even during accidents.

6.) Also like all products EV will mature like smartphones and become more stable and usable.

7.) The important issue is the EV users is experience of manufacturing and regulation in the industry is not mature. New players are entering the market and don't have adequate experience or understanding. People should focus on companies which have done proper research and testing which will improve anyways in couple of years. Also government should understand and implement a more comprehensive policy on safety of EV's",none,,2023-12-02 21:52:34.471006,0.0

1. Range anxiety
Yes, it exists and there's no denial to it. Doesn't the same exist in ICE? If the fuel reading nears zero, it will make you rush to the nearest pump, wait in long queues and sometime fill them up in bottles due to poor planning. I can rest assured without worrying a petrol pump closure late at night or because of strike, as I can charge anytime at home.
Another big anxiety for ICE owners is ""fuel price anxiety"" that becomes talk of the nation every so often. A jump of 25 paise makes everyone jump, doesn't happen that with EV.
2. Battery
Yes, it's a major cost consuming factor. And like all things electric, this also needs proper care to be used. And so do ICE vehicles. Most EV batteries come with 8 years warranty, way above the standard 1 year on ICE engine (extendible to 3 years) or 1.5 lakh kms, which is again more than ICE. And call it to protect battery or what, EVs are very robustly build and safe in a casing that protects it even in cases of full frontal collision. How many ICE cars boast that?
3. Leg room
Yes, it's average. I have a sub 4 meter car, and rarely does a car give comfortable long time seating in this range. Precisely why on a long drive, one should get off for an hour while your legs rest and car gets charged ;)
4. Go green
Earth metals do contribute to pollution, and so does any extraction from earth: be it metals for engine, and it is well known that fossil fuels are the biggest contributors to pollution.
I used to be very sceptical, but Gaggan sir helped me take a stand in my early days. It is disappointing to see this video as the tone it sets is very incorrect. Elsewhere in the comments I read about India's early acceptance to computers, and it presents an excellent opportunity to why we should embrace the new tech and be its leaders. Elon isn't the richest without a reason.
And personally, no ICE trade off can match the peace of ownership, calm of driving and joy of silence I get with an EV.",none,,2023-12-02 21:52:34.472838,12.0

How is buying 1.5Ton piece of metal going to save the environment???
It is only relatively better for the environment PROVIDED it completes an entire lifecycle i.e 1.5Lakh kms in 6 Years.
Also, 50% emissions come from battery so if you claim a battery in warranty then that battery will come with a carbon tag of 50% of the carbon emitted in the manufacturing of the EV.

 The first smartphones were too costly and less features with charge issues, but people bought it.. Now we have smart phones @ budget price with specs... 
Petrol - Diesel are coming to an end, the future is Electric cars... So, just like the first smart phones, first Gen EVs are here...
:
Who can buy the first gen EVs now? 
1) There are people who buy automatics of creta, seltos etc for city use, their daily avg drive is below 250 kms. They goes long in very rate situations, for them for that same price Nexon EV will give double performance with savings , just 50 km per day can save 12 Lakhs in fuel cost within 8 years
2) Battery replacement is in 2030 * 8 year warranty, by that time we can have replacements for battery @ good price, whereas the present petrol - diesel cars we buy now will be struggling with fuel price and global air pollusion. 
3) TATA comes with Li Phosphate batteries, (others not) these batteries last extra long. It wil llast more than 10 years. 
4) EV cars are the best in class automatics way ahead than DCTs, + savings in every km.. Drive it once..And decide.",none,,2023-12-02 21:52:34.689380,0.0

In normal car you spend 18 lacs . 

you can buy harrier , creta , saltos , safari , scorpio with tension free life petrol/diesel dalo or kashmir to kanya kumari  . after 3 years sale it to open market you will get around 12-13 lacs very easily . cars like toyota brand you may get even few more lakhs . 

In EV cars you spend 18 lacs for nexon , 22 lacs for mg ev , 30 lacs for atto 3 . 

non of above car in normal driving condition (90km/ph to 100 km/ph ) even on highway will give to 500 km range .

We should do charging system advance as only fifteen minutes for full charging. 
Vehicle companies should be give guarantee forever. Battery change without charges forever. There is nothing charges for changing battery. Because old battery has some cost. It is enough for company. 
There are two way to get follow battery vehicle. 
1-- companies should do less cost. On the hand above suggestion should follow. It is genuine way of business. 
2-- companies stop to make petrol vehicle or company makes cheap technology petrol vehicle. It seems to me that it will be done so for getting purchased to new product. It is not good way but it is the worse way of business . About to do so is not a good businessman. Because Francis Bacon has written in an essay 'Of Experience '
Businessman is a cheap person.

The sites should be hilly so that natural head can be used. Water will not be an issue. Private organisations should be encouraged to set up such plants.

One more suggestion. Encourage startups to establish local gobar gas plants at village level. It will promote,
(1) use of locally available resource Gobar.
(2) Will promote cow rearing.
(3) will promote organic farming as organic manure will be available.
(4) will relieve government from importing, bottling and transportation of lpg.
(5) will create employment at village level.
(6) will improve the economy of farmers as they will get income from gobar.
(7) if available biogas is in excess, can be used for fueling vehicles.

Myself  SWAPAN PYNE and I am unfortunately a customer of your EV two wheeler.

This is a very painful experience for me with your branded two wheeler,that i have purchased and taken an extended warranty of additional 20000 km / 5 year  based on your presentation of performance but now I feel cheated from your dealer and company .

The battery failed to charge after 4500km and then the battery was submitted to the dealer on dated 23 March 2020 but still the solution was not done and my two wheeler was standing at home. It's critically disturbing my daily life , job and mental peace.

I hope you can understand my situation and if not then I have to take legal action.

Addressing the differing standards in charging interfaces may help in the short term regarding better access to EV charging stations, however I believe that EV manufacturers and electrical suppliers need to look at another option which eliminates a physical charging interface altogether.

Just as some cell phones and other electrical devices can be charged/powered using induction coils, surely that technology can be adapted to work somehow with EVs. Burying coils under pavement in parking lots, or even in some roadways could provide a useful alternative to specific park-and-charge locations that will likely get overwhelmed with visitors as EVs become more prevalent.

It is viable to replace a fossil fuel car with an electric car and then expect all our problem will be sorted? When we all know that will not be the case, and this channel has acknowledge that many times. 

The long and short of it, is that more cars on the road is not viable any more. Because its not just about CO2 emissions there many other pollutants a car produces include tyre ware. Not to mention the roads themselves made of tarmac constantly being resurfaced or patched up. This concept 'the car' is no longer viable. 

The common perception is that to get from A to B you need a car. This is coming from growing up with cars, reading in news and media about car transportation and its multiple advantages, getting hammered with advertising for a status symbol to simply a means of freedom a car offers to each and everyone, and there is very little alternative showing that the same opportunities and advantages can be achieved by using public transport. Public transport in the media is being mostly portrayed as being cumbersome, too expensive, useless, not going anywhere and the likes. 

My idea for public transport for short journeys could be trams, for longer journeys the trains. I would prefer to paint my picture, but YouTube does not allow that in the comments below. 

Time is another factor, as an example: we at our works were asked to a meeting in London, we were given a choice, coach or train. Which do you think people favoured the most out of 15k people? 

My solution is nothing new; Trams can be more easily introduced and automated to simple stop/go, in short, you would book your Tram seat, this in turn allows monitoring of demand, and at peak time more Trams are on the track. We have plenty of Iron you say, so in that case building tracks and over head power cables, and steel wheels, should not be a problem, that in the transition phase, cars and trucks can drive over these tracks. Once a Tram is seen to come into your close to pick people up, or bring somebodies shopping, or is seen over taking lines of stationary traffic because of congestion, road works, brake down etc, perception starts to change. 

A Tram will only need a small battery for lights and heating and for gap stops on the over head power cables, you could even have hybrid Coaches that turn into a Trams in the transition phase. Railway tracks are less damaging to the environment than roads, so in my distant future roads are reduced to pathways for walking and cycling, and main roads turned to tracks, where grass is allow to grow. There are no road signs its all automated like a Tesla. The Tram will know where its going, how many people are picked up and dropped off and where, and each Tram will offer first and second class rides. It will have no front or rear ends, because it will work either way. Goods could also be transported at night when passenger numbers are low. You order your food online and it turns up in Trams park outside your home like a take away or shop on wheels, and all with minimal pollution. 

The future is what ever you want it to be, but choose wisely because what ever you choose you will be stuck with the consequences for generations to come. 

EV's in the short to long term are for the wealthy in my opinion, because polluting will become a tax.",none,,2023-12-02 21:57:07.554940,0.0

Several are claiming that there is a shortage, and thus giving themselves an excuse for restricting the supply of EV's. The Chinese EV manufacturers are not complaining about shortages, and neither are Tesla. BYD has trebled its monthly output of EV's over the past 12 months and plan to do it again next year. We're looking at them producing 300,000 electric cars in a month, and making many of their own batteries.

It's worth noting that president Xi has issued an order in the past couple of weeks, forbidding Lithium producers from price gouging; raising the price of the metal to about 18 times its level of two years ago. If he has issued that decree, then he knows for certain that suppliers are being far too greedy, and that it is causing the roughly 100 Chinese EV manufacturers to sell their cars at a loss, in an effort to remain competitive. This has meant that only two companies which produce EV's in China are making a profit, namely Tesla and BYD. BYD are making only a slim profit.

Maybe it was too early, but you also made no mention of the new Sodium/Lithium hybrid batteries, which have almost the same energy density of Li-Ion batteries, and about the same energy density as Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries. Both of those types are being improved steadily, but Sodium has the advantage that the cells are much more tolerant of both colder and hotter temperatures. It also has the big advantages of being much more abundant than Lithium, and being much cheaper to refine and use. After all, it's in every grain of common salt that you see. These new batteries are already being evaluated in prototype form in EV's. Results have been good so far, and there are definite plans to market lower cost EV's with this battery type. Estimates are that the new battery will cost about 50% of the price of Li-Ion batteries, and even undercutting LFP battery manufacture costs by almost 25%.

LFP batteries contain no Cobalt. Cobalt is also being reduced drastically in Li-Ion cells, with the aim of replacing it entirely, thus circumventing the dubious supply chain issues.¬†

Another development is the recently patented chemical method of extracting Lithium from ores, which can extract well over 95% of the Lithium, and could reach 99.5% extraction levels, at about the same price as the older methods. Less pollution is caused by this method. This technique also compares well against the most common methods of Li extraction which only recover about 45% to 50% of the metal. What that means is that formerly waste clays and ores can be reprocessed, to remove at least as much Lithium as was removed during the first processing, thus essentially more than doubling the amount of available Lithium.

My understanding is the Li is what provides the energy in a battery.  Making a more dense energy battery might just mean increasing the amount of Li to other materials, but an A-hr of battery energy may still require the same amount of Li.   You need to extract more energy per kg of Li to improve the supply situation.  Not sure if that is happening, but from what I see most currently produced batteries are all about the same energy density.  The other approach (probably a necessity) is to develop car battery technology based on a battery that uses more abundant materials.",none,,2023-12-02 21:57:07.556437,0.0

Li-Ion batteries are good for urban bound vehicles in densly populated countries where travel distances are moderate and access to chargers is good. Once we move away from that scenario the current battery technology becomes a problem. In many countries across the globe vehicles are used for many more things than urban commuting. The number one selling vehicle in Australia at present is a large four door ute which is generally 4wd and combined with similar vehicles of other manufacturers make up three of every five new vehicles sold at present. No EV made at present can do what these vehicles can do and are regularly called on to do and they never will if Li-ion battery tech is all we will have. They don't have the energy density needed to bring them down to a size that is usable for vehicles like I have mentioned and I doubt very much if they ever will. Despite all the hype we have seen regarding heavy vehicles being battery powered soon we are yet to see any for the same reasons I have talked about, the power density to battery size and weight ratio. That brings me to the next point, the mass uptake of EVs in our congested cities will be great for pollution reduction and should be done for that reason alone but the actual reduction in Co2 going into the atmosphere will be a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed. Everyone is talking like it is the saviour of human kind and Net Zero is a shoe in once we change over the worlds car fleet. If you pull up the CO2 stats for any developed country you will find that transport in total is one of the lowest percentages of the countries Co2 emissions. In Australia all transport combined is only 18% of our CO2 output. That includes shipping, aviation, trains, linehaul trucks, busses and of that 18% cars and light commercials vehicles make up 7.5 %. If we are going to electrify the rest of the transport mix we need more than just batteries and for those that use batteries we need something far better than Li-ion.

It can be used for daily driving, and to drive across the Country if we needed to, without having to worry about where to charge and how long it will take.

Put a big battery in the car problem solved. But with that big battery the weight increases and efficiency decreases. 

My ioniq 28kWh is one of the smaller batteries in todays cars. With that small and low weight, i can get a range of 200 km. If it had an heatpomp for heating in the winter i wouldn't loose the 20% of range that  i do now. With that 200km i can easily do my daily commute of 100 kilometers to work and 100 kilometers back to home. It's not ideal in winter because i have to charge at the office. But my commute of 200km daily isn't nowhere near average. 

Today's cars get a battery of 60kWh that give a range of 350 / 450 kilometers. Is that needed for every car? Sure there are jobs that will need a care with that range and maybe more.  But is doesn't need to be the standard.  If i had 220 kilometers in winter i would be more than happy.  Cars with less battery capacity would be cheaper to make also. So another win.

Only consequence of a smaller battery is that you have to charge every day. With vehicle to grid/ home you as a user will benefit from plugin in every night. You start every day with a fully charged car and help balancing the grid. It's a shame that company's with big parkings lots aren't obligated to let everyone charge during the peak hours of solar energy so we can solve the duckcurve problem as well.

They both join the anode/cathode (depending on whether the battery is being charged or discharged), where the electrons reduce/oxidise the the anode/cathode and the lithium ions intercalate into the anode/cathode (i.e. move into small voids within the electrode material). They remain ionized throughout the whole process.

All those losses without even taking the manufacturing of the vehicle and its battery into account. Some sources state that only 33% of the power generated in the US makes it to its destinations due to losses.

A diesel engine burns diesel at 30-50% efficiency depending on the age of the motor. 90-99% of the pollutants (excluding CO2) generated in latest diesel engines are captured by emission control systems.

Electric mopeds and motorcycles are also much lighter and require less energy to move around, so batteries can be smaller.

I'm sorry but I've quit watching many of your videos since I've in a Big Oil Beat-down type depression.  I've fought for batteries for decades and taken on so many battles that I have the scars to prove it.  I was writing to Swiss financial institutions 20 years ago asking them why the transition to renewables was taking so slow.  Never an answer.
I recently saw a lecture given to a Finnish political group by Simon Michaux, who I believe is a materials professor.  It was both a brilliant and eye-opening lecture, but based on a flawed concept.  First of all he talked about the problem with our fossil fuel driven world.  In 2005 there was a push to transition our world to fracking and tar sands.  There was an enormous spike in materials, toxic chemicals, energy and electricity demand to start the transition.   After 2-5 years a frack well is worthless even though they have a financial structure of a 30 year ROI.  So they sold them to Pension Funds and the financial crisis started in 2007.  Even though the evidence was right in front of his eyes, Simon downplayed the reasons for that spike.  But he did show that we are on the downslope of post-Peak Oil. We're running out.  There are many people talking about deindustrialization, but it is only that Europe has been sucking on an oily teat and it's running dry.
The false premise was that Simon based his calculations of magically transitioning every vehicle today into renewable.  And there he showed that we wouldn't have enough materials.  But I don't think anyone has ever said that was the goal.  You were correct to state that we have to transition off of an individual car economy since that is unsustainable. 
I had a meeting with our Swiss government a couple years ago since we could have transitioned two factories to make batteries and solar panels.  With 5,000 vehicles with a 50 kWh battery, that would give a virtual battery of 250 MWh.  A grid operator assured me that solar and wind energy would be possible with such a capacity.
I tried to get the backing of the Greens and the climate groups.  No support at all.  And the government laughed and showed me the door.",none,,2023-12-02 21:57:08.082253,0.0

Now the first group of people anyone would think of to mine this amount would of course be children.
